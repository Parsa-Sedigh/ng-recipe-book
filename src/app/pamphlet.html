<!-- 1. Introduction & Why Pipes are Useful:
Pipes allows you to transform output. Also there are some pipes for different types of outputs and also we have some pipes
for synchronous and asynchronous data.
EX)
Let's say we have a property in .ts file of component:
username = 'Parsa';
and we want to output in html file. So we can use string interpolation like:
<p>{{ username }}</p>

But let's say we decide we want to make the output all uppercase. BUT WE WANT TO DO THAT, ONLY WHEN WE WANT TO OUTPUT THAT PROP.
So we don't want to change the property itself to uppercase because might we want to use it in other places not in uppercase.
But you want to transform the way it is displayed once you render it to the screen in that file. So we can use the uppercase
pipe:
<p>{{ username | uppercase }}</p>

2. Using Pipes:
A pipe is only responsible for transforming the output, so the right places to use it, logically, is the template files.

3. Parametrizing Pipes:
We want to configure a pipe. For example you want to change the format of the output date which pipe date outputs those data.
We can add a parameter to configure a pipe by adding a colon.
date pipe can get a string parameter.For passing multiple parameters if the pipe supports those params we can say:
pipe:<param1>:<param2>:...
EX)
<p>{{ server.started | date:'fullDate' }}</p>

5. Chaining(combine) Multiple Pipes:
The order of pipes when you have multiple pipes is crucial.
Important: In this example, the uppercase pipe would applied to result of server.started | date:'fullDate' .
EX)
<p>{{ server.started | date:'fullDate' | uppercase }}</p>

In the las example, if you first apply the uppercase pipe and then the date pipe on a date type, it would throw an error.
Because you are using uppercase pipe which is for strings, on the date type. Because the order of pipes is crucial.

6. Creating a Custom Pipe:
Sometimes you need some functionality in pipes which isn't in built-in pipes. So let's create shorten.pipe.ts file.
Now the shortenPipe class needs to have a special method to be usable as a pipe and whilst not strictly necessary, but it's
a good practice to implement a certain interface in the class of custom pipe which by doing this, it requires you to implement
a method in that class. The interface is PipeTransform and by implementing it, you need to create the transform method.
Now the transform method NEEDS to receive the value which that value should get transformed in () of it. Also that method needs
to receive a list of arguments. But for now, our pipe doesn't take arguments anymore because currently it doesn't need to take
them. So I omit to receive any other arguments, so we only receive the value.

Important: The transform method in a custom pipe class, always needs to return something because we always put something in
 the pipe and then we get something out of the pipe. So the pipe class HAS TO return sth.
 So you need to get sth out of the pipe otherwise that pipe won't work.
Now in order to shorten that value, we can use substr() on the value we receive.

Now in order to use that custom pipe, we need to go to app.module file and add it to declarations array.
Learn: So just like components and directives you also need to add custom pipes to declarations array of app.module.ts .

Now we also have to add a special decorator to the class of custom pipe.

7. Parametrizing a Custom Pipe:
It would be nice if we could allow the user to specify the number of characters which at that point, you want to shorten the
value.Because right now we're always using characters as the limit and it is hard coded. Instead we can receive a second arg
in transform method. Now the user can pass a parameter tou our pipe.
So any args after value argument in transform method, is the args that the user can pass to the custom pipe.

8. Example Creating a Filter Pipe:
ng generate pipe or p <name of pipe>

9. Pure and Impure Pipes (or How to fix the Filter Pipe):
Angular is not rerunning our pipe on the data whenever this data is changes. So as soon as we change what we enter in that
<input> which adds a server, for example even add a blank space on that input and then remove that space, we would update the
data that is shown or our pipe.
So CHANGING the input or the data that is going into the pipe, will trigger a recalculation or in other words, will trigger the
pipe to get applied to the data again.
To be precise, updating or changing the data which that data is arrays or objects, won't trigger the pipes and this is a good
behavior. Because otherwise, if this behavior of angular didn't exist, angular would have to rerun this filter pipe whenever
ANY data on the page changes. This would be really bad because that behavior would costs a lot of performance and this is also
the reason that why no built-in filter pipe exists in angular. Because you might say filtering is a common task. But because
adding filter pipe would typically have a high performance costs if you want to enforce that pipe to being updated even if
you are in filter mode, angular team didn't add such a pipe.

Important: So by default just changing the value of filter pipe won't trigger it. But we can enforce it to work. So be aware
 that the following change will make sure that whenever we change data on the page that the filter pipe exists, our filter pipe
 would be recalculated. So this might lead to performance issues.

So you can enforce to this pipe to be executed whenever the data changes, by adding a second property to the @Pipe() decorator
and it's called pure and now you can set it to false. By default, the pure prop is true.
Now with this, if you write stable and click the button, the servers would added.
The reason is that the filter pipe gets recalculated whenever data changes. But leading to performance issues.

So by saying pure: false , so now the pipe is not purely focusing on whether it's arguments was changed or not and therefore it
also looks for whether anything on the page changes or not and then would be recalculated. By default (pure: true) the pipe
will just focus on it's args and see if it's args was changed or not and then would recalculated.

Learn: How make a pure pipe, impure without using pure: false which leads to performance issues? In other words, I want to
 fire the pipe manually. But how?
 One way to make a Pure Pipe becoming impure is add a parameter to your Pipe. So when you want to refresh, just change the
 parameter. So that pure pipe will be fired when that parameter we added to it, changes.
 Another way without adding parameter to the pipe:
 Pure Pipe will be fired when its input(the first parameter of transform() method of pipe, which is the value param) has a
 new instance. So with TypeScript 2.1+, the below code will copy the original object with a new instance, and lead pure pipe to
 be fired:
 let copy = { ...original }
-->
<!-- 10. Understanding the async Pipe:
Let's say we have a HTTP request to a server and we get the data back from that server after 2 seconds and we are using that
data in our template. So if you output the data which would be available in some time in future, you would get [object Object].
and that is true because it is a promise and an a promise is an object. But after 2 seconds it would be some data not that
[object Object] . But angular doesn't know about that because it doesn't watch our object and actually it doesn't see that
object transforms to something else in future. It just know it's a promise, I'm done! and this behavior is good because it
saves us performance.
So we can use async pipe. This promise, recognize that we have a promise or observable which in the latter case it would
subscribe to that observable automatically and when the promise is resolved or in case of observable it sees that the data
is sent through subscription, that pipe will print that data to the screen.

Learn: A promise is an object. -->

<!-- 12. Using a Service for Http Requests:
Right now, because we're using http requests in the component, our component is grown big. Also in the .ts file of our component,
we have some code which is indirectly related to the user interface(the user interface is the job of the components). Yeah,
of course we want to send a request when a button is clicked(clicking the button is related to UI!) and then we want to display
the response of that request(this is also related to UI!). BUT! Transforming the result of that request has nothing to do with
UI. So it's a good practice to outsource that work into services. So the services are part of your angular app that do the heavy
work and the dirty work and your components are releatively LEAN and are mostly concerned with the template related work.
Like isFetching property and ... .So let's create a service named posts.service.ts and in that file we export a class named
PostsService . Now when you create a service you can make it available for whole app. There are 2 ways of doing that.
1) You can add @Injectable() before exporting the class and in () of @Injectable() , you need to pass an object and in that
object we set providedIn prop to 'root'. This approach is better.

2) You could also add that service in providers array of app.module.ts file.
In that service, we want to have our HTTP request methods and we only want to get the responses in our front-end or better say
components. So therefore in this service, we can add a method named createAndStorePost() and in there we get title and content.
Also we want to fetch or get our posts. So let's create fetchPosts() {} .
Now we want the http for sending the requests right? So let's inject the HttpClient service in this new service and then save
it in a property of this class. So we must add constructor() {} of this class and ...

@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class PostsService

constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

createAndStorePost (title: string, content: string) {
  const postData: Post = {title: title, content: content};
  this.http.post<{name: string}>(<'url'>, <data we want to send via this http verb>)subscribe(() => {

  });
}

fetchPosts () {

}

Now we can call the service methods in our component files to send the requests from components, based on some condition in
template files. So in .ts file of that component, we need to include this newly created service inside () of constrcutor.

.ts file of component:

This onCreatePost() method would be called in template file based on some click by the user or ... and then when this onCreatePost()
method is called, we call a method from service to send a http request.
onCreatePost(postData: Post) {
  this.postService.createAndStorePost(postData.title, postData.content);
}

onFetchPosts () {
  //this.isFetching = true;
  this.postsService.fetchPosts();
}

Remember: We don't need to create some props in the service file to store the results of subscribing to http requests. Because
isFetching (which is used to indicate if the results of request are came back or not?) and loadedPosts props, clearly belonged
to our component and not to the service file.

Now the logic of sending the request is outsourced in a service. But when you have a prop for specifying whether the request is
in progress or not, (like isFetching prop) , when you outsource the code for sending request, from the .ts file of component.
We would have problem. Because right now, that prop is in .ts component file but the code of sending request is in service file.
Because the component is where we use those props by displaying the incoming data from service and ... .
Important: Now if you need to be informed about the http request process or in other words, get informed about if the results
 was came back or the observable was complete or ... , we can return the sending request code which would return an observable
 in the service file and then when we're calling that service method in the component file, we can use subscribe() on it.
 Now why we are subscribing in the component file instead of subscribing the observable right in the service file and after
 using http verb? Because we want to change some props which indicates the progress or state of the observable of that request
 and we know these props are in component file. So we need to use .subscribe() in the component file and NOT in the service
 file to get informed about the changes of loading and errors and ... .


13. Services & Components Working Together:
For fixing the props which aren't informed about the result of observable, we can use a subject in the service file and in that
file, we can next our posts when we got them and then we subscribe() to that subject in the component file. But remember, subjects
are good to use if we have multiple components which are interested in data of a http request. So a better approach in this case
is to simply return the result of this.http.get() or ... in service file. So in service file, we don't use .subscribe() when
sending http request, instead, in service file we just return the prepared observable which is because of http request. So
currently the http request won't sent. Because as I mentioned, http requests are only sent when someone is interested in that
request and just by saying: this.http.get(...); the request won't sent. Now by returning the observable of http request in
service file, we can call that method which returns an observable in component file and then use .subscribe() on it to actually
send the request and in component file, BEFORE subscribing to observable we can set this.isLoading to true

So now, we moved the result handling of http requests into the component, but more heavy lifting or the part which is detached
from the UI which is sending the request and the transformation of the resulted data with pipe() to the service file.
This was the BEST practice when working with angular and http requests. So we moved the managing of loading state and calling the
actual request and getting and managing the data which is the result of sending http request.Move these tasks to component file,
therefore by doing that, be informed about the result of http request and state of pending the request by calling subscribe()
on the observable and by using a prop which handles the state of loading of request.

Sometime you can also subscribe() to observable pf http request right in the service file:
So also remember: If your component DOESN'T CARE about the response of http request and about whether the request is done or
not, in that case, there is no reason to subscribe() in the component file. For example when you create a post and want to post
it to server.

Learn: When you have some code duplication in 2 or more methods, you can outsource the duplicated code to a new PRIVATE method of
 the calss which those methods with duplicated code are exist in that class and then call that private method in those methods.
 We declared that new method, private, because we just need that method in THAT exact class and nowhere else. So why define it
 public or protected?

14. Sending a DELETE Request:
When you have a method that is responsible for deleting a post, you can define the delete operation in service and then
subscribe() to that method in service is component file. Why subscribing to it in component file and not in service file?
Because for example maybe we want to get informed about our data was cleared or deleted to change the state of the traker
properties or the properties which do other stuff.
The first arg of subscribe() which is a function, will only executed if the observable was succeed.

15. Handling Errors:
When we're interacting with severs, things can go wrong, so we need error handling when interacting with servers. For example
when you're sending a request with incorrect data, or the server is offline! or there's an error on the server or user is not
authenticated for sending that request.

Test mode when creating a database in firebase means read and write to this database is granted by everyone! Therefore no one
needs to authenticate himself for doing these works.

You can simulate that error condition by firebase! So in firebase go to database>rules . For doing that, you can set ".read" to
false, there would be no condition which under that condition you would be allowed, not even if you are authenticated. Now
if you send get request for fetching posts, you would get an error and when you get the error you see that we still have
loading... !
1) The first way of handling errors:
Learn: The first arg of subscribe() would be executed when new data is came from server. The second arg os subscribe() would
 trigger whenever we got an error and we can receive that error by providing an arg which gets the error.

Now for error handling, in the .ts file of component, we can create a new property named error and set it to null initially and
then in html template of that component we can add a <div> for showing errors and some elements in that <div> like <p> which
show the error messages to the user. Now the idea is, we only show that <div> by using *ngIf like:
<div class="danger" *ngIf = "error">
  ...
</div>
Also you can add an errorMsg property to store the error message which is written by you or ... and then show it in template.
If you need more information about the error you can dive deeper into the error object you're getting in the arg of second function
of subscribe() .
Also by doing this, we must check if we have NOT an error when showing the loading... message.
Important: Because if we have error we shouldn't show the loading... message and instead we want to show the error <div>

16. Using Subjects for Error Handling:
2) The second way of handling errors:
This other way of handling errors could be nice in cases like when you send a http request and didn't subscribe to it in your
component file. It's easy for us to react to an error in the component, if we do return the observable from the method that
is used to send the request from service file and then in component file we subscribe to that method. Because with these, we can
pass second arg which is a function for error handling to subscribe() . BUT what about when we have subscribing to the method
which send the http request in the service? How we can handle error of those cases, which we aren't use subscribe() in the
component(because the latter approach is the normal and usual approach)?
Now obviously you could return the observable in the service too and simply subscribe in the component, instead of of subscribing
to it right in the service because you might said component doesn't care about the result of this http request and this approach
would not be wrong. But we can also use a subject instead of making the subscribe() in the component in this special case which
is the component doesn't care about the result of http request.
The subjects are useful if you have multiple places in your app that you want to handle the error in those places which are using
the same method which is for sending http requests.
So let's create a new instance of Subject() in the class of service file and that subject would give us a string eventually
so: we can say <string> and when we are subscribing to that method in service file, we can give it a second arg and in that
second arg which is a function, we can call next(<the error arg>.message) and after that we must subscribe() to that subject in
all places we're interested in that error (because remember, the purpose of subjects is that we have multiple places).
So in service file which is the place we are subscribing to the method which might get an error when sending http request and
also there are some places which are using this method(so with one subject we can handle the errors of all of them) we can say:

method() {
  this.http.post or get or ... <eventually type!>(<'the url'>, <data of post or...>).subscribe(() => {...}, (error) => {
    this.error.next(error.message);
  });
}

So for example in one place we can say:

error = null;
private errSub: Subscription;

this.errSub = this.postService.error.subscribe((errorMessage) => {
  this.error = errorMessage;
});

ngOnDestroy () {
  this.errSub.unsubscribe();
}

Also it's a good practice to unsubscribe, if you get rid of that component(we do that kind of stuff when the component is
destroyed so let's implement onDestroy in that component). So therefore, we created a new pro which is named errSub and then store
the result of using subscribe() to that new prop.

17. Using the catchError Operator:
No matter how you handle the errors, what ca be useful is a special operator that assists you for handling errors and that operator
is named catchError .
Now when you are using .pipe() on .subscribe() you can add this new operator to get the error object which can be received in
() of the second arg of subscribe() and in () of catchError() you can get the error object which you can get in () of
the second arg of subscribe() and in that, you can send data to analytics server and some generic error handling tasks and
maybe not related to UI but it doesn't matter because we are in service file not component file. Also you can use Subject here
too!But maybe you have some behind the scenes stuff that you want to do when an error occurs and in there, once you're done
handling that error, you should pass it on though. So it defenitely needs to be able to reach subscribe() . So we now need to
create a new observable which wraps that error and for doing that we need to import throwError from 'rxjs'.
throwError is a function which will yield a new observable by wrapping an error. Or in catchError you can also throw a new
custom error which YOU generated.
Important: You need to RETURN the observable which is created by calling throwError() to be able to subscribe to that observable.
 Because hey! You use subscribe() to subscribe to an observable, therefore if you don't return the result of throwError()
 function which is a new observable, you would using subscribe() on nothing, because that series of fucntion wouldn't return
 anything in that case.

 The error handling of this example doesn't do anything but it's just an idea that shows you could consider catchError()
 if you have some generic error handling task that you also want to execute in pipe() .

EX)
service file:
fetchPosts () {
  return this.http.get<{ [key: string]: Post }>(<'url'>)
  .pipe(
  catchError((errRes) => {
    return throwError(errRes);
  })
  )
  .subscribe();
}

18. Error Handling & UX:
For making user to be able to get rid of the error message, we can create a button in template like:

template file:
<div *ngIf="error">
<button (click)="onHandleError()">Okay!</button>
</div>

.ts file:
onHandleError () {
  this.error = null;
  this.isFetching = false;
}

Now if you click on that button, the error message would gone but the Loading... message wouldn't.
Important: So what we can do is to reset isFetching or isLoading property whenever we get an error too. Because even if we have
 an error, we definitely not fetching data again
 When we get an error from the observable, the observable wouldn't be completed yet! So in error handler function of subscribe()
 we must set this.isLoading to false.
 So even with an error, you aren't fetching data anymore, so the loading state definitely changed and therefore it should
 reflected in the data and in the UI(template file) too.
 Now by clicking that button, you wouldn't see loading... anymore.

19. Setting Headers:
Right now we're configuring our HTTP requests in posts.service.ts file.
When you have a backend which requires authorization therefore would look for authorization header in the request we would send
to server, we must set custom headers or if you want to set your own Content-Type or you need to attach your own custom header
because your api which you are sending the request to, needs that custom header.
So we can pass an object in second arg of .get() or third arg of .post() or ... and in that object you can configure bunch
of stuff like headers. Now headers prop of that object, takes a HttpHeaders object and in () of HttpHeaders we pass a JS object,
in object literal notation which you would write key-value pairs of your headers.
Learn: So headers are key-value pairs.

EX) service file:
fetchPosts() {
  return this.http.get<{ [key: string]: Post }>(<url>, {
    headers: new HttpHeaders({
      'Custom-Header': 'Hello'
    }),
    params: new HttpParams().set('print', 'pretty');
  });
}
-->
<!-- Important: We can use Subjects to communicate between components. In one component we can emit new values in that Subject
      by using .next(<the value>) and in other places we can subscribe() to that subject in order to listen to that subject.
      Also remember when using Subjects, in the component that you are listening to that Subject or in other words you are
      subscribing to that subject, you must clean the subscription to that Subject. In order to do that, we must create a
      prop in that component which we are listening to that Subject and with that prop, we must assign the result of
      subscribe() to that subject, to that created prop and then when the component is destroyed (in ngOnDestroy()) we must
      use unsubscribe() on that prop which holds the subscription to that subject.

Always place the built-in imports of angular to top of the other custom imports which import the created stuff by ourselves.

SUPER IMPORTANT: YOU CAN USE TERNARY OPERATORS INSIDE {{}} (string manipulations).

Important: By using .slice() without any args on the array you want to create a copy from it. So for getting a copy of array,
 you can use .slice() on it which returns the copied array.

Important: For deleting an element from an array, we can use splice() . splice() allows us to start at a specific point which
 that specific point is the first arg and then say how many elements we want to delete in the second arg.
 Also remember to call the splice on a copy of the array.
-->
<!-- 20. Adding Query Params:
It depends on the endpoint of API you're sending the request to, which query parameters are supported.
You can see the previous code snippet example.
HttpParams() works a bit different than HttpHeaders() . Because you must call set() method on HttpParams() .
'print', 'pretty' will change the format, which firebase returns it's data.
If you want to set multiple query params you can create a let variable like: (why let? Because we want to mutate that variable)
We can repeat that append() method on params variable because the old params will be kept and the new ones will be added.

const searchParams = new HttpParams();
searchParams = searchParams.append('print', 'pretty');
searchParams = searchParams.append('custom', 'key');

21. Observing Different Types of Responses:
Sometimes you need to access to entire response object not just extracted body data, sometimes you need to find out which
status code was attached or you need to find out the response headers. In such cases you can change the way angular HttpClient
parses the response .
For example for post() , you can add the third arg but instead of specifying headers or params or ... we need to change observe
prop of the third arg in post().

observe: 'body' means that you would get that response data extracted and converted to JS object automatically.
If you use, observe: 'response' , when you subscribe to that observable, in the arg of first function we pass to subscribe() ,
you would get the FULL http response.

So observe: 'body' will extract the response body and convert it to JS.
Learn: observe: 'body' is the default value for observe.
The ok property of the data response we get in first arg of subscribe() would be set to true, if status is in 2xx regeion. Like
200 .
SO with observe you can change the kind of data you get back.
This was how you observe the response data. You can also observe sth different. For example when sending delete() request,
in second arg of that method you can add an object and then say:
observe: 'events'

Learn: tap() operator allows us to execute some code without altering the response data. So basically we can do sth with
 response but not disturb our subscribe() function and the args we passed to subscribe() as functions.
 You don't need to return anything from tap() because it won't interupt the normal observable data flow. Because it just taps
 in response then allows you to do sth and then automatically let the response pass through.

So if you want to check if we did get back the response? Then you can just compare the type of event you get in tap with
HttpEventType.<...> . So:
... .pipe(tap((event) => {
  if (event.type === HttpEventType.response) {
    //So if the comparison returns true, that means the event we're receiving is actually our response, so we can access the
    //response body
    console.log(event.body);
  }
}))
You can use the things that are available on events, to find out the request or response are in which phases. For example
when using HttpEventType.sent we can say the request was sent or not and ... .

22. Changing the Response Body Type:
You can also configure the response type in the configuration object of that HTTP request method.
responseType: 'json' means the data in the body of your response is JSON and that tells angular that it should automatically
parse that data in body and convert it to JS object.

responseType: 'text' tells angular please don't try to convert the data in body to a JS object. So maybe you are getting some
json but you don't want angular to parse it so we can use this option.
The default responseType is 'json'.
blob is used for files.

23. Introducing Interceptors:
Currently, whenever we want to send our HTTP requests and whenever we want to configure sth about these requests and responses
like parameters, we're doing them on per request basis and oftentimes, that is the way it should be. Because every request
might need different headers.

Let's create a new interceptor by creating a file and there we want to attach some header to every request that is required for
authentication on our back-end.
Remember: Interceptor is basically an angular service.
So let's create a file named, auth-interceptor.service.ts :
export class AuthInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {}

When you implemented the HttpInterceptor interface, this interface forces us to add a intercept() method in the class that
implements that interface.
intercept()() method gets 2 args

This example is a setup that you need to use, to have some code which would run right before the request leaves the app but still
let the request leave the app.
EX)
import {HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest} from '@angular/common/http';

export class AuthInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
    console.log('request is on it's way!');

    /* By calling this, you let the request continue and you also should return the result of this to really let the request
     continue.*/
    return next.handle(req);
  }
}

Learn: HttpRequest is a generic object. Therefore you can use angled brackets to basically inform angular about the type of
 data that request will yield.
 next is an object which will forward the request by calling a function on it. Because interceptor will basically run before
 your request leaves your app.

 Important: So intercept() will run right before the request is sent and right before the response is forwarded to subscribe() .
  So intercept steps into the request flow and next is the object with a method you need to call in order to let
  the request continue it's journey.

So intercept() method will allow us to run the code which is inside it, right BEFORE the request leaves our application and
right before the response is enter subscribe(). So by saying:
return next.handle(req); you let the request continue it's journey.

Now we need to provide this service but in a special way. So let's go to app.module.ts file and add the file of this interceptor
service to providers array but in a JS object and not just add the name of that service. The first key of that object is
provide and the value of that is HTTP_INTERCEPTORS which is a type in '@angular/common/http'. So this is the token which by it,
that injection can later be identified by angular. So it will basically know that all of the classes that you provide on that
token(so by using that indentifier), should be treated as HTTP interceptors and therefore should run their intercept() method
whenever a request leaves the application.
The second key is useClass key and for the value you must point to the interceptor class that you want to add as an interceptor.
and the last prop is when you have more than one interceptor and you must inform angular about that fact which you must say
angular please don't replace this interceptor with previous one, by adding multi: true . So this was just a dependency injection
which is supported by angular that allows us to register a service under a different identifier(HTTP_INTERCEPTOR).

With that, angular will automatically grab all of your http interceptors and run their intercept() method whenever request
leaves the app. -->
<!-- 24. Manipulating Request Objects:
Important: The req object is immutable inside the intercept() method. So inside of that method you can't say:
 req.url = '...';
 that won't work and you would get errors.

So if you want to modify the request, you have to create a new one.
Inside of req.clone() , you can pass a JS object where in that object you can overwrite all of the core things.
You can add completely new headers with headers: new ... OR if you want to keep the old headers, you simply do that by using
req.headers.append() .

So a typical use case for interceptor is that you receive the req via req arg and then you change it and then return the
modified request not the original one.
EX)
intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
  const requestModified = req.clone({
    url: 'some-new-url',
    headers: new ... OR req.headers.append('Auth', 'xyz')
  });
  return next.handle(requestModified).pipe(tap((event) => {
    console.log(event);
    if (event.type === HttpEventType.response) {
      console.log('response arrived, body data: ');

      //This would give the response body
      console.log(event.body);
    }
  }));
}

Important: type: 0 is "request is sent" event.

25. Response Interceptors:
Learn: handle() returns an observable.

next.handle() gives you an observable. Because I think it makes sense because in the end your request is an observable and you
subscribe() to it. So next.handle(<request>) in the end, is the request with response in it and all of them are wrapped in
an observable and therefore we can add pipe() which in the () of pipe() you can do sth with the response. Yeah response. Because
the response would come back from server and first it can goes to pipe() and then subscribe() .
We can use tap() to look inside the response here.
Learn: In () of tap() we always get event.
Remember that we can observe different kinds of responses with the angular HttpClient no matter what you chose there. But
in interceptor, you always get an event, so you have the most granular access to the response you could possibly have.

26. Multiple Interceptors:
Let's create logging-interceptor.service.ts file:

This interceptor is just responsible for logging. So you can comment the logging messages in prior interceptor.
...
intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
  console.log('Outgoing request');
  return next.handle(req).pipe(tap((event) => {
    if (event.type === HttpEventType.response) {
      console.log('Incoming response');
      console.log(event.body);
    }
  }));
}

Important: So the return next.handle(req) is actually the response which is wrapped inside an observable.

Important: The order which you provide the interceptors is very crucial. Because that would be the order which the interceptors
 executed.
app.module.ts:
providers: [
  {
    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
    useClass: AuthInterceptorService,
    multi: true
  },
  {
    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
    useClass: LoginInterceptorService,
    multi: true
  }
]

<!--  Course Project - Http:
2. Backend (Firebase) Setup:
We use realtime database and not cloud firestore in this project and for now choose start in test mode option, so with this
option we have read and write access without being authenticated.
Now we have created our database in that firebase project.

3. Setting Up the DataStorage Service:
First we need a place to make HTTP requests.
Of course we could add (click) listeners to the save and fetch data elements in header component and then in component .ts
file of that header, we could include the angular HTTP service and make the http request of that component in that .ts file of
that component.
But one disadvantage of that is that in that header component, we have the buttons but we don't have the data that we want
to interact with it and the data we want to interact with, are recipes and those are managed in recipe service.
Therefore the better place for making those requests is the recipe.service file.
But let's create another route which is optional and create a new service for that in shared folder and that service is
data-storage.service.ts . But this is optional because you could manage it in recipe service too but we created another service
in order to really focus on that HTTP functionality. But handling the HTTP requests in recipe service would be fine because
in the end in that case, we are interacting with recipes.

Learn:
 Theoratically, @Injectable() is optional and you don't need to add it to all of your services but it is required to add it
 to the service which we inject another service to that service.
 The alternative of adding the new created service in providers array of app.module.ts file is to use providedIn prop in
 object that we pass to @Injectable()

For using angular HTTP client service, first of all, we need to import HttpClientModule in app.module file and importing of
this needs to be at top of the custom file imports in that app.module file. Now we need to add it to imports array of that
file and before the imports of custom files in that imports array.

These were crucial in order to unlock the HttpClient functionality in our application. With this, in any part of our app we can
use angular HttpClient which means we can include that module in any service or file and in the file or service you want to
use that module, you need to say:
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
and then include it in () of constructor of that class.

4. Storing Recipes:

After sending the request for saving recipes, for the first time, firebase will create the recipes node. Because we have
/recipes at the end of the request url.
Important: Also firebase would create some cryptic keys for those data and it always does that when you POST data or
 in other words when you attach ONE data piece at a time. But if you PUT data, firebase assumes that you know what you're
 putting there and therefore if you wanted ids for the data that you PUT, you would have to generate and add ids on your
 own. But in this case, we are fine with normal indexes like 0 and 1 and ...
-->
<!-- 5. Fetching Recipes:
Learn:
 A really crucial question when we are declaring the http request in service files, after declaring them, where we want to
 subscribe() to those http requests to send it?
 The answer is where are we interested in the response of the http requests?
 For example when sending a get request to get the recipes, are we interested in response of that in header component ? NO!
 Instead, in get or fetch recipes case, it would be nice to just subscribe in the data-storage service where in that service,
 we already injected the recipes service. Because maybe we can do something with the recipe service like to push or to move our
 fetched recipes where they are fetched in data-storage service into the recipes service which in the end if the place that
 we manage all of our recipes like deleting them or ... .
 So let's subscribe in data-storage service for fetching recipes.

 IMPORTANT: When you have some things in a file, that we have got some other places which those other places are interested in
  those things too, when those things were changed, all of those other interested places must be informed about the changes
  that happen to those things. So in that case we can use Subjects in order to inform all of the interested places or files.
  Also it's better to store or keep those interesting things like our data (an array of recipes which are in recipe service)
  in ONE place. So we can call next() method on prop that is storing a Subject , in order to inform all of the places that are
  interested in those recipes and in those places, we need to subscribe to that Subject. Also don't forget to unsubscribe() from
  that Subject in ngOnDestroy() of those places or files.

6. Transforming Response Data:
Important: When you have a variable or a prop that is not initialized, and if you are pushing some elements to it in advance,
 you MUST INITIALIZE that prop or variable with an empty array like [] . Otherwise you would get an error when trying to push()
 some element into that array which says that empty variable or prop is undefined.

Right now we have a bug. Right now, if you create a new recipe without any ingredients it's fine to have not any recipes.
So generally our app works. But to prevent nasty bugs, when we fetch the recipes, it would make sense that we make sure we always
have ingredients, even if it is just an empty array. But the data that we loaded in the end has some ingredients and that
prop is not undefined. Because otherwise, if we try to directly interact with the ingredients, we could get errors and for that
we can simply add a pipe when we are fetching the recipes. In map() operator if fetchRecipes() we get our recipes, but maybe
among that recipes we have some recipes without any ingredient.
The map() javascript method is for arrays and it receives an anonymous function which that anonymous function would executed
for every element in that array.

Learn: map() operator in rxjs, allows us to transform the data.

7. Resolving Data Before Loading:
Currently if we are in recipe detail page like /recipes/2 , and you reload, you would get an error.
But the bigger problem is that when you reload, we tried to load the detail page for a recipe which that recipe doesn't exist!
Because we're fetching our recipes from back-end and if we haven't pressed fetch data button before, well then we simply have
no recipes.
So it is simple! If we are currently in recipe-detail page and then reload the page, although we had the data of recipe we are
currently seeing it before reloading, right now we can't see it. Because we need to fetch data and if we reload, the data
that we were seeing by pressing on fetch data is gone! So accessing the details of a recipe is doomed to fail!

One approach for fixing that would be to simply add a guard that prevents us from accessing recipes/2 or edit route which has
an id encoded in it's url, when we have no recipes loaded(so after we refresh the page, we would have no recipes loaded and
therefore the guard won't allow us to see that page after refresh) and instead would redirect us to /recipes for example.

The second approach is to use a guard but another type of guard, which is a resolver.
Learn: A resolver is essentially some code that runs BEFORE a route is loaded to ensure that certain data which the route that
 is going to load depends on that data, is existing. Also in the resolver class, we need to implement Resolve interface and
 Resolve is a generic interface which means we need to define which type of data will be resolved in the end by implementing
 the Resolve interface, it forces us to add the resolve method which that method gets data about the route which is type of
 ActivatedRoute which this route arg is a snapshot and also gets the current routing state which in that resolver we named it
 state which is type of RouterStateSnapshot. From there we can for example get the id we are requesting and ... .But we want to
 load all of the recipes anyway otherwise, things like editing them won't work correctly because we need to reinsert those recipes
 into an array and ... .
So let's add it in the recipes folder next to the recipes component and we name it recipes-resolver.service because in the
end it is a normal service.

Learn: We use @Injectable({providedIn: root}) to provide a service application-wide automatically and it doesn't matter that we
 are injecting another service to that service or not. Because you can even add that decorator to services which we don't inject
 other services to that service which has this decorator.

8. Fixing a Bug with the Resolver:
Currently if we fetch our recipes and then try to edit one of them, the changes are not saved! So whenever we edit a recipe and
click the save button to save those changes, we go from .../recipe/<id>/edit to .../recipe/<id> . So we go from
RecipeDetailComponent to RecipeEditComponent and we set a resolver to execute when we visit RecipeEditComponent and that
resolver fetches the recipes from database and therefore because we din't save the edited recipe, the old recipes in database
override the changed recipe and therefore the changes don't apply.
The reason for that is that the resolver which is used(executed) WHENEVER we visit the routes that we used that resolver on those
routes. That resolver fetches new recipes from server and therefore, it simply overwrites our existing recipes, including our
changes to those recipes.

The solution is to first check whether we do have recipes therefore don't fetch recipes from db OR we don't have recipes, therefore
fetch from db.
So let's inject RecipesService into the recipes resolver and then get the recipes from that injected service.

<!-- 2. How Authentication Works:
When the user enters his credentials like email and password, then, that authentication data is sent to a server where the
data is processed for validation. So we can't do that validation in the browser because all of the javascript code in
browser is exposed to our users and therefore not stored securely and also the logic of that validation could be changed
by users in browser as well. So users can edit or even disable the javascript in the browser!
So we can use authentication to create a nice user experience and to kind of show different parts of our application based
on authentication status of the user BUT WE CAN'T CONTROL OR VALIDATE the authentication status in the browser and that has to
happens in the server, so in a place where the users of our application can't do anything.
Now if you think about a traditional web application, where the server would render pages for different URLs that you enter
(so where the server would render different HTML pages for different URLs), you would work with a session. But remember, with
angular, we built SINGLE page applications. That also means we decouple the front-end or the angular application from the back-end.
So for the different pages we visit, those pages gets handled by angular and it's router and javascript in the browser takes over
and re-renders pages or parts of pages as our user interface and also re-renders the current state of the user which requires
that page.

Remember that we still reach to back-end as you learned in HTTP requests, so we can still interact with a server but the server
would be a restful API and therefore we'll not use a session because restful apis are stateless(the same applies for graphQl apis.)

Important: So the core thing is that our back-end or our server will be an API. So our server would not be a server that renders the
 HTML pages that we're on them and therefore sessions can't be used. Because our server doesn't care about the clients. Why
 it doesn't care? Because the clients and server are decoupled from ea ch other, but remember, they can communicate with each other
 through the HttpClient which angular offers us but besides that, there is no connection between server and client. In other words,
 the server doesn't know about the clients and therefore, a session is not the solution about authentication. Because a session
 would be stored on the server and as I said, the server doesn't care about the clients of our app.

Instead, we will use a different approach, where in that approach the server will validate the user credential and if all of that
credential is valid, the server will send the client a JSON web token typically.
Learn: A token is a an encoded string which contains a lot of metadata and remember that token is encoded and not encrypted.
 Which means this string could be unpacked and read by the client and remember, that token or encoded string is generated on the
 server with a certain algorithm and a certain secret which only the server knows and only the server can validate incoming tokens for
 their validity. Because the idea is that the client, which is our browser or our angular app, stores that token in some storage like
 the local storage of the browser and attaches that token which server sent, to any request that thereafter of receving that token,
 is sent to the server by the browser or angular app, which that request with atached token to it, needs to be authenticated by the
 browser.
So let's say we need to be authenticated, in order to be able to store recipes, then we need to attach that token in the header or
in as a query parameter to the request we're sending to the server. So in this example, we must attach that token to store recipes
request.
The server is able to validate that token because the server itself! create that token with a certain algorithm and a certain
private key which is only known to the server not the client. That is how a token is secured.
Important: So we can't generate or edit the token, in the client. Because as soon as we do edit or generate a new one, it won't fit
 the algorithm and private key (secret) which are used on the server and therefore, the server is able to determine the token is
 valid or not and therefore the server can block access if the token of request was invalid.
 So this is why tokens are secured. Again it is, because the server knows more than the client but we give the client one crucial
 piece which is required to authenticate subsequent requests. But that crucial piece is given by the server and it can't be generated
 on the client because of security reasons.

So create token- store that token- attach that token to request and ... .

3. Adding the Auth Page:
In this project, the auth page is available in an unauthenticated state. So the user doesn't need to be logged in to visit that
auth page. Because forcing the user to being logged in, would defeat the purpose of authentication page.
On the other hand, the recipes page should be locked down and should not be available if the user is not logged in and the same
goes to the manage dropdown which is in the header. So that dropdown should only be shown if the user is logged in, because otherwise
the user shouldn't interact with it. Or maybe we could but the actions in that dropdown shouldn't do anything, because that would
send request so they need authentication.
The shopping list should always be accessible.
So let's create auth component.

Learn:
 In a component, we always export a class and then use @Component() on that class. Then in the () of @Component, we pass a JS
 object and there, we must use selector prop and for value of that we use: 'app-<name of component>'.
 Then we need to tell angular to where find the template of that component, by specifying the templateUrl prop and for value of
 that, we pass the route to the html template of that component.
 Now we need to go to app.module.ts file and add the new component to declarations array and also you must import it like:
 import {<name of class of component>} from '.../<name of component>.component';
 remember: In import code, don't use the .ts extension.

Now let's make sure we can switch between login and signup mode.

4. Switching Between Auth Modes:
In order to switch between login and signup in the auth component, we need to manage the currently active mode. Therefore you could
add a property like isLoginMode.
So the idea is that you store if the user is currently is in login or in signup mode and you adjust the user interface and ... .

5. Handling Form Input:

6. Preparing the Backend:
Our backend doesn't have to be firebase BUT it needs to offer endpoints which you can use them to create new users and to log users
in, in order to get such a token. If your api supports that, then you can use that api. But we use firebase because it doesn't need
to write backend code.

So right now, go to authentication page in firebase and now, we have to setup a sign in method. Actually before do that let's go
to realtime database page and then go to rules and in there if .read or .write are set to true, that means everyone can read(get the
data in database) or write(store some data in database) our data in database. In other words, everyone can interact with our
database currently.
But this was required in the past because we had no authentication although it's not secure.
But right now we need some authentication, so change the value of ".read" and ".write" to "auth != null"
That will tell firebase that only authenticated users should be able to read and write data in our database.
Actually we wanted to lock down everything(entire firebase database), if users are not authenticated.
Now, if you fetch data from app, you get an error which is 401 error says you're not authorized.
So let's go to firebase enable authentication so we can slowly add the logic to be able to visit our authenticated routes again.
So in authentication page of firebase, click on sign-in method and choose email/password and JUST enable the top one.
Now you got the built-in authentication which is enabled right now, where you can send requests to certain endpoints offered by
firebase, to create users and to login users and you'll see the users in authentication page>users.
-->
<!-- 8. Preparing the Signup Request:
Google firebase auth rest api and you can see the rest endpoints which firebase offers to you to creating users and logging users in.

The firebase auth rest api is different than we used before with firebase database rest api.

In the response of signing a user up, we get back idToken from firebase, therefore we don't need to sign in the user after sign in
him up. Because we automatically get that token when the user signs up.

So we need to send requests, therefore we need a service for sending HTTP requests for authentication. So in the auth folder
let's create auth service. That service is also responsible for managing the the token of the user.

The API_KEY of your firebase is in left navbar of firebase console and in that gear icon>project settings>Web Api Key .

9. Sending the Signup Request:

10. Adding a Loading Spinner & Error Handling Logic:
For creating a loading spinner, let's create a folder in shared folder and call it loading-spinner and then create the loading-spinner
component.

11. Improving Error Handling:
throwError which is in rxjs package, will create a new observable that wraps an error. Because RxJS always needs to return an
observable and catchError operator, catches the error but you still need to return a new observable and that observable should
still wrap that error so that it still ends up in second callback when you subscribe to that method which returns an observable.

12. Sending Login Requests:
First let's make sure that we can send a request to the firebase login endpoint as well.

When something is of type Observable, we know that an Observable is of type generic. So we need to specify the type of that
variable or ... with Observable<The type that the observable will eventually yield> .

13. Login Error Handling:
Currently when a user wants to login, if his credentials are incorrect, we see [object Object] in error we write to the screen.
So in login, we don't use the error handling that we use for signup. Therefore we are printing the whole error response that
firebase sent for us for login.
Now actually there would be nice to SHARE that error handling logic between both signup and login observables. So we can create
a private method which is only used in auth.service file(hence it is a private method- it is private because we use that method
ONLY in that file) which we named it handleError method.

Also it doesn't matter to have the method that we used it BEFORE the method was declared in a class. It doesn't matter. So we can
declare handleError() after we using it in a class.

14. Creating & Storing the User Data:
For storing the user data(or other specific data about sth) we can create a model for it.So in auth folder we can create user.model.ts
file. Why in that folder?
Because users are specific to auth component not other components.
Important: A subject object is a generic type. So we have: variable or prop = new Subject<...>();

Learn: tap() operator allows us to perform some action without changing the response. So it steps into that observable chain
 but it doesn't stop it or block it or change it, it just run some code with the data(response of HTTP request in this case) you get
 back from the observable.

After doing this video which we create the user and signin or login him, then we need to redirect the user in the UI and also
update the UI. When I said update the UI, I meant for example show a logout button and only show the manage button, if the user
is logged in.
So we must update the entire header, based on the auth status of the user.

15. Reflecting the Auth State in the UI:
Let's start by forwarding the user to a different route once the user is logged in and signed up. Now since we always want to
redirect the user once we authenticate him, we can do it in two different places. We can do it in handleAuthentication()
or we can do it in the component and inside of subscribe() but only in success of login! So you prefer redirecting in the
component of inside of a service? Also if you need no data from either the service or the component and you have no strong reason
for doing it one place or the other, it's up to you.
Also you could argue that you want to keep your service file a bit cleaner and don't interact with the user interface in the
service or in other words you don't want to directly influence the user interface and therefore you maybe don't want to
interact with the router in the service file. So let's do the redirection in the component file. So let's include the router
in that file.

Right now if you are logged in and reload the page, the user object is gone and therefore we are not authenticated anymore, with
just a reload!
(When we have the user object, it means we are authenticated.)
So currently if we are not authenticated, for example if we reload the app then all of the previous state is lost and we are not
authenticated anymore, because the user object doesn't exist anymore in the memory after reloading the app. So we need to add
some code to presist that user object when we reload the page.
Right now, if we are not logged in we can still see recipes. So even we write some code that makes us can't go to recipes because
we are not authenticated, we also want to even don't be able to see that recipes tab.

So the next step will be that we must correctly reflect the current authentication state in the UI.
So we can disable the recipes link if we are not logged in.
Now we need to get the current authentication status of the user in the header component. In other words, we must find out
do we have a user object with a valid token or not? and we also need to use that information to update the template correctly.

So, right now, we manage our user object through a subject in auth service. So let's go there.

Now we need to storing the users tokens and protecting certain routes(so we shouldn't visit them even if we directly enter the url-
why directly? Because right now we don't show those routes in the UI if the user is not authenticated, but we also need to
protect those routes). But before doing that, let's make sure we can use our token to fetch data because that's still not working,
even we are authenticated, but why?? We will answer this in the next video.
-->
<!-- 16. Adding the Token to Outgoing Requests:
Right now we have a problem. Why our authentication status ignored when we try to fetch or save data?
Because JUST WE KNOW THAT WE ARE AUTHENTICATED AFTER A SUCCESSFUL LOGIN and we have our token somewhere in the user object, but
firebase doesn't know that we are authenticated and we are not attaching that token into the outgoing requests and therefore
firebase has no chance of understanding that we have a valid token(because we are authenticated, we have a valid token).
Important: So we need to add that token to the outgoing request to let firebase know about we have a token and therefore we are
 authenticated. So for doing that, we need to manipulate our outgoing HTTP requests like fetching and storing data which
 need the user to be authenticated.
Hence we need to look into the data-storage.service, where we have fetchRecipes and storeRequests and those requests need to
we attach our token(the token we are storing in the user object which is a subject in our auth service) to them.

For doing that, let's inject auth.service to data-storage service and then we need to get access to the user object in those
request declarations. Now we could set up a subscription to the user object BUT we don't care about every change to the user object
which is a subject(because we knew we subscribe() to a subject in order to get informed about the changes of that subject).
Instead when we try to send store or fetch recipes http requests, we just want to get the token of the currently authenticated
user and we don't want to have an ongoing subscription to the changes of user object which is a subject.
Hence in the auth service, we now should also store the token or the user object in a way that we can access it through different
means. So not through a subject which is great for reactively updating the user interface but we also have a way of on-demand
fetching of the user object. Now there are couple of ways of acheving that, since we are only interested in the token of user
object, we could just store the token in the prop of AuthService which initially is null and eventually(after
the user authenticated- So we can set the type of that prop to string, although initially it's null) will hold a string eventually
and we will set the token to token prop whenever we also emit a new user subject.
That approach would be possible and wouldn't be wrong but we can also use a different type of subject.
So let's change the type of user subject to BehaviorSubject.
Learn: BehaviorSubject behaves just like the other Subject, which means we can call <the prop which holds the subject>.next() to
 emit a new value and we can subscribe to it to get informed about new values which that subject emits.
 The difference is that BehaviorSubject gives subscribers immediate access to the previously emitted value even if they haven't
 subscribed at that point of time which that previous value was emitted.
 This means we can get access to the currently active user even if we only subscribe after that user has emitted.
 So this means when we fetch data and therefore we need the user token at that point of time, even if the user logged in before
 that point of time which will be the case, we get access to that latest user object. Therefore, BehaviorSubject needs to be
 initialized with a starting value.

Now in data-storage service, now we can reach out to the auth service and get the currently active user and then for example in
fetchRecipes we don't want to make an ongoing subscription to the user by subscribing BehaviorSubject but still we need to
subscribe to get the user object.
So to make sure we only get the user once and thereafter we're done, of course we could manually immediately call unsubscribe()
when we subscribe() to the user BehaviorSubject like:
this.authService.user.subscribe().unsubscribe();
OR you can use .pipe() and then use take() rxjs operator.

So we didn't want to get informed about every change of user object, we just wanted to on-demand fetching of the user object.
Learn: take(1) means we only want to take one value from that observable(which in this case is user BehaviorSubject) and thereafter
 it should automatically unsubscribe. So this also manages the subscription for us and gives us the latest user and then
 unsubscribes and we won't get future users because we just want to get user object on demand when fetchRecipes() is called.
 So when fetchRecipes() is called we get the latest(because we are using a kind of subject, although we are not actually getting
 it everytime the user object changes, in this method) user and then we unsubscribe from that BehaviorSubject.
 If you used an ongoing subscription we would get the all of the users when they changes even when we don't need them. Because
 we just want to get the current user(if we have of course!) when user wants to fetch recipes. So we subscribe to that
 source but by using take(1) operator.

Important: A subject is great for reactively updating the UI.

17. Attaching the Token with an Interceptor:
We can use the same logic we used in fetchRecipes() in the storeRecipes() too. But since we are using the angular HttpClient
we could also use another feature offered by that client because what we do there in fetchRecipes() and storeRecipes() is we
manipulate all those outgoing requests in the same way and we can use an interceptor.

Important: We can use an interceptor to manipulate our requests instead of manually copy some logic for some requests multiple
 times.

So let's add that interceptor in auth folder, because it is used for attaching a token for authenticating the user for the
firebase(the user is authenticated by app but he still needs to be authenticated for sending requests to firebase.)
So that interceptor is an authentication-related interceptor it must goes to auth folder.

Now, after creating the interceptor class, in @Injectable() don't add an object with providedIn prop for it, because we will
provide this service differently than others and we have to provide it in such a way angular understands it.

The intercept() method needs to get 2 arguments- req which is a generic type of HttpRequest. That generic type means which type of
data that request will return eventually. Also we need to provide the next arg of type HttpHandler.
-->
<!-- 18. Adding Logout:
Before storing the user token in a presistant way on the user computer, so it would exist even if the app reloads(because currently
reloading the app would cause losing the state of user) and also before protect certain routes. Let's add the logout functionality
to auth service.

Now we need to presist the token so it won't gone once we reload the app.

19. Adding Auto-Login:
So we must make things up so once we are authenticated, we don't just keep that status as long as as we're navigating around in the
app, but we also keep that token when we reload the app.
Important: Because when you reload the page, your angular application restarts and the old angular app is dumped and since
 currently we're managing everything in memory, so remember currently we are storing the token(which is our identifier
 for authenticated and unauthenticated user) in the user model which happens in javascript only and which therefore happens
 in memory. Since we manage it all in memory, we'll lose all that state whenever the application restarts because that memory
 gets cleared automatically.
 There is no connection between the last time we ran this angular app on this web page and the current time we are running it.
So there is no connection and therefore memory is lost. So if we want to store that token, we have to store it somewhere else and
not in a javascript variable or a class prop. We have to store it in a persistent storage which must survive the page reloads
and browser restarts, that we can write to that persistent storage and also we can fetch data from that storage.

Learn: In a browser, you've got different storages, you can't access the normal filesystem on your device but you can work with
 cookies or local storage of browser which is an API exposed by the browser to store simple key-value pairs basically on the
 filesystem but controlled by the browser and we will use local storage in this project to store the user token.
To do that, let's go to handleAuthentication() method in auth service which that method is where we do create our user object
and emit it to our application and there, besides emitting it to the application, we also want to store it in browser storage.
localStorage.setItem() allows you to write an item to the local storage and store data there.

Important: Right now, we want to store an object in localStorage which is the user object, but you can't simply pass
 javascript object to second arg of setItem(), instead we have to convert it into a string. So we can use JSON.stringify(<object>).
 JSON.stringify(<object>) , serializes a javascript object or in other words, it converts a javascript object to a string
 version of it!
Now after authentication, if you go to application tab of devtools and then go to Local Storage you can see the userData key
which you set in setItem() method and it's value and it's a javascript object which is converted to string.

Now with all of that being stored there, we can also retreive it from there when application restarts.
For that, let's add a new method named autoLogin() in the auth service file. Why we named it autoLogin?
Because it basically is a method that will try to automatically set the user to login when the application starts and it will do
that by looking at the local storage of browser and checking whether there is an existing user snapshot stored or not.
So in that method we need to retrieve data from local storage.

localStorage.getItem() is a sync method.
-->
<!-- 20. Adding Auto-Logout:
We need auto logout too! Because our token will expire and it has an expire time of one hour from when we get it and therefore
right now we have a bug in our app because the token will expire but our application won't reflect that. So we are automatically or
manually by logging or signupping the user, logging in the users in forever. Because we have that snapshot of user object in local storage
and we never clear that snapshot. So we should clear that user object in local storage when we logout, but right now it will never
clear automatically. Because if the token expires after one hour, nothing changes in our app. So first in auth service, we should make
sure that since we store a snapshot when logging in(or sign up), in the logout we must clear that user object in localStorage.

Now we also need to set a timer which starts when we get the token for the first time, so we know when to invalidate that token
at a later point of time and for that we create autoLogout() method in auth service.

Learn: You can get the time in milliseconds from a variable or prop which is in Date type, by calling .getTime() on it.
 So for example you can say: new Date().getTime() which returns the time of current time in milliseconds.

21. Adding an Auth Guard:
We want to PREVENT the users from visiting /recipes if they are not authenticated.
Learn: A route guard allows us to run some logic, right before a route is loaded and we can deny access if a certain condition
 is not met. You can name the class of guards, like AuthGuard or like AuthGuardService, because they are technically services.
 So we need to use @Injectable() , because the guards are basically services.
 The class of guards, must implement CanActivate interface. So you also need to implement canActivate() method in class of that guard.
 Also remember, the canActivate() method, needs to be implemented in a certain way. Because it has to receive the currently active
 route(which we name it route) which is type of ActivatedRouteSnapshot. Also this method needs to get the router state
 (we named it router) which is of type RouterStateSnapShot.
 Also canActivate() HAS TO return either a boolean or a promise which eventually will yield a boolean(so we need to use generic
 type for that) or an observable which will also eventually yield a boolean value.

In canActivate() we want to return the status as we can derive it from our auth service. So let's inject the auth service in that
guard.

Learn: !!user is a trick that converts a true-ish value (in this case it's user) like an object(anything that is null or undefined),
 to true so to a real boolean or it converts a false-ish value like null or undefined to a real boolean and in this case the value of
 that boolean would be false.
Now go to app-routing module and add canActivate prop to the prop you want to protect with a guard.

We used a BehaviorSubject for user object and not a Subject because a BehaviorSubject unlike a normal Subject,
always gives us to the previous value and that helps us ensure that we can get access to the user object even if in this
part of the application where we need it, we missed the previous emitted user(missed means for example we are using a take(1)
operator and therefore we don't have an ongoing subscription to that Subject and we just need the lates emitted value. So
if you use Subject, you can't get the latest emitted value of Subject, because normal Subject don't let the observers get
immediate access to previous emitted value, so we need to use BehaviorSubject). But why in take(1) we say we are looking for
the LATEST emitted value of that BehaviorSubject?
Because we haven't an ongoing subscription to that BehaviorSubject, therefore we don't get informed immediately when a new
value of BehaviorSubject is emitted. So we can't use just normal Subjects for using in take(1) observer. Because take(1)
makes the observer to doesn't always observing that obs and when that file or that code gets executed, it needs to get the
latest emitted value. So that Subject needs to maintain the previous value in order to inform the observers which havn't an
ongoing subscription to that BehaviorSubject.-->

<!-- Dynamic Components:
Dynamic components are components which you can create them dynamically at runtime. So let's say for example you want to
show an alert or a modal, which should only be loaded upon a certain action. That modal should be implemented by using a dynamic
component. So we need to load that kind of component ON DEMAND and also we need to get rid of that component. Because a modal
or ... always shouldn't be shown!.

2. Adding an Alert Modal Component:
Let's create an alert dynamic component in shared folder.

3. Understanding the Different Approaches
Dynamic components in general just means that you wanna display some component dynamically which means that component is not
always there but it's there once sth specific happens in your code. Therefore you typically want to control programmatcially
when that component should be loaded or displayed. One way of controlling that is to use *ngIf. *ngIf way use a declarative
approach, which means you simply add the component selector in your template and then you use *ngIf to only load it when a
certain condition is true. So you use *ngIf to control whether the DOM really has that condition to display the dynamic component
or not.
RECAP: In *ngIf the dynamic component embedded via it's selector(declaratively)
       *ngIf controls whether the component is added to DOM or not.

The alternative approach is sth in the past named dynamic component loader. This was a helper utility that you shouldn't use it anymore,
but in the end, now it's a general concept about creating a component in code and then manually attaching it to DOM.
So in this approach, in the code you must control how that component is instantiated and data is passed into it and also when that
component must be removed by yourself.
SO everything that *ngIf automatically does for you, in this approach you must do on your own.
But this approach allows you to control it entirely from your ts code and don't have to touch the template for loading that component
and ... .

4. Using ngIf:
Using *ngIf approach is better where in this approach you show some component when some condition is met.

Now let's use other approach where we create the dynamic component ENTIRELY in code and also control it from there.

5. Preparing Programmatic Creation:
Let's comment the *ngIf approach for showing app-alert component.
Now we need to create that alert component programmatcially and show it programmatcially  from inside the .ts code.
For that, let's create a new private method in the component which we want to show that dynamic component. So I created showErrorAlert()
in auth component and this method in this case has to be called whenever we have an error and therefore in onSubmit() method, when
the obs throws error, we must call this new method in order to show the error alert. Also we pass the error message to that method.
Now we don't need that error prop, which we were using it in template file, but still I didn't comment it.

Important: It's better to name the attr directives: app<name of directive> . So for selector prop of directive we would have:
 selector: '[app<name of directive>]' for example: '[appDropdown]'.

6. Creating a Component Programmatically:
Now we created the placeholder directive, let's go to the place where we want to add that directive and therefore the dynamic component,
which is the auth.component.html . Now you could use a normal <div> for using the placeholder directive on it, but there's a better
element in this case which is <ng-template> .
Learn: <ng-template> is a directive which will not actually render anything to the DOM but still is accessible in the
 angular templating language. So using <ng-template> instead of adding another HTML element for a placeholder to outputting the
 dynamic component is great because we don't add the overhead of an extra DOM element there, instead we can simply just get access
 to a place in DOM in order to output that dynamic component. Now let's add our placeholder directive to <ng-template> .
 So we can get access to a place in DOM without actually render anything there with <ng-template> and using placeholder directive.

So now we have that <ng-template> element which is considered by angular when it parses the template file but which does not
render a real element to the real DOM which is useful in our case, but we will be able to get access to that <ng-template> in
DOM, because it is simply remembered by angular.

Learn: We can get access to <ng-template> directive, by using @ViewChild() and we must pass a selector to () of @ViewChild() also
 you can pass the NAME of local reference as a string to it.
 Also you can pass a type and it will look for existence of that type in the template file of that .ts file.
 So in this case, if we pass the placeholder directive as a type to @ViewChild() , it will automatically find the FIRST PLACE
 where we used that directive with the given type to @ViewChild() , in the template of that .ts file.
Important: When you want to pass in a type to @ViewChild() don't pass it as a string. Then @ViewChild() will try to find the
 first occurrence of that type in template or DOM.
 Also don't forget to add the {static: false} as the second arg of @ViewChild() .
 Then you must store that @ViewChild() into a property.
In our project, we named that prop which holds that @ViewChild() , alertHost. Because it will be the place where we host our alert
and that prop would be of type PlaceHolderDirective because that prop is holding a @ViewChild() which is pointing to a type of
PlaceHolderDirective.

So now we get access to the directive we used in the template by using @ViewChild() and we store that reference into alertHost prop.
Now we can use this prop which holds a property named viewContainerRef for the factory which is for outputting the dynamic component.
We can get access to that viewContainerRef prop because it is a public property of that directive. (You could also work with that
viewContainerRef prop without storing it in a new variable.)

Now the next step is to clear anything that might have been rendered in that reference before, by calling clear() on that
viewContainerRef.
Important: So nw you understand, as I mentioned, viewContainerRef is not just a pair of coordinates of some place in DOM, instead,
 it's an object that allows you to interact with that place in the DOM.
 When using clear() on a type viewContainerRef, simply clears all of angular components that have been rendered in that place which
 viewContainerRef points to it. So it's neccessary to clear anything there, before rendering sth new there.

After clearing everything that is inside of place we want to output the dynamic component, we can use the component factory of
that dynamic component to create that dynamic component in that reference and this is simply done by calling the viewContainerRef
of that place and calling createComponent() on it and createComponent() does not need the type of that dynamic component but instead
it needs the factory of that component. Now it will create that dynamic component in that place.
But we will get an error! Which says: "No component factory found for <type of dynamic component>. Did you add it
to @NgModule.entryComponents ?"

Remember: Each dynamic component has it's own factory. -->
<!-- 7. Understanding entryComponents:
If you are not getting the previous error that I mentioned and it just works without any errors, because you are using angular 9 or
higher.
But why we get this error?
Because it didn't find a component factory for AlertComponent(our dynamic component). But we created that factory, why it didn't find
it?
Because we need to add that factory to @NgModule.entryComponents.
For this, you need to know how angular works behind the scenes, when it comes to creating components.
Of course any components as well as directives and pipes that you plan to use them, you need to add them to the declarations array
of app.module.ts file. This is crucial for angular in order to understand what components, directives and ... you have in your
application. Because angular does not automatically scan and you need to tell it which components exist. But this alone, makes
angular aware of that component, so it is able to create such a component when it FINDS that declared component or ... in one
of 2 places. Now what are those 2 places?

The first place would be in your template files. So if angular finds a selector like <app-recipe-item> it basically looks into
declarations array, finds it there and therefore it is able to create that component.

The other place where angular will look for create a component, is in app-routing.module and in routes array. In that array, when
you point to a component, angular will also check that component in declarations array and if it finds it there, it is able to
create such a component and load it.

But one place that does not work by default, is when you want to create a component MANUALLY IN THE CODE which is what we are
doing in auth.component. There we're creating our own component factory and passing our component to it and there, angular does not
automatically go to the declarations array. So you have to deliberately inform angular that in this case the AlertComponent(the
component that we're trying to create) will need to be created at some place and angular should be prepared for this.
So now angular will prepare itself for that creation when it finds that component in a template or in the routes config(
app-routing.module file).
Now in order to tell angular to be prepared for creation of that new component, you need to add a special property to the object
you passed to @NgModule() in app.module file. So add entryComponents prop which is an array to that object. It's an array of
types of components, but only components that will eventually need to be created without a selector or the route content being used.

Important: So whenever a component is created by it's selector or you use that component in the route configuration, you
 don't need to add the type of that component in entryComponents array.

Depending on the angular version you are using, you might not need entryComponents array. So if you are working with ng9 or higher
you can omit entryComponents by default because in those versions, angular under the hood, uses a different rendering engine(Ivy).
But if you use that prop, it doesn't throw errors.

Now angular is ready to create that component whenever you prompt it to create and you prompt it, by using createComponent() .
Now you created that component, programmatically. But there are some problems.-->
<!-- 8. Data Binding & Event Binding:
Currently we do have @Input() and @Output() for getting the message from parent component and show it in that component and for
closing that alert box. But we're not using property or event binding on our component at the moment. Because we created that
component in the code, so we can't use [] or () for property and event binding.
So when you create a component by code, you can't use () for event binding and [] for property binding on that component.

Important: So how we can pass data into that component which is in parent component (passing data to a component is possible by
 using @Output() in the child of that component folder, or by creating some props in that folder and use them on that component)
 and how we can listen to an event on that component or remove that component(because it's a dynamic component)?
Well, we simply have to store the component that we created in some const or variable, so we can work with that component thereafter.
So we must store the result of createComponent() in a variable or ... . In this case, the name of that variable is componentRef.
Because it's just a reference to that component.
Now we can interact with that component by using that variable.

There's no too many use cases of using the second approach of creating a component dynamically, but if you are author of a library
and you want to give the users of your library an in-code way of showing a component, that would be the case of second approach.

The content that are inside a *ngIf, won't show up until the condition is true. So you are not cluttering your DOM with unused
content. Because they won't even show up if the condition of *ngIf isn't true.

Recap of second approach:
You create your own component factory and then you use a viewContainerRef which you can get access to it with a helper directive,
to dynamically create AND render your component and any component that are rendering like this, needs to be added to entryComponents
array in your @NgModule() .
 -->

<!-- 22. Angular Modules & Optimizing Angular Apps:
2. What are Modules(angular modules or NgModules):
Angular modules are ways of bundling angular building blocks together. Angular building blocks could be components, directives,
services, pipes.
You have to group them altogether into angular modules in order to make angular aware of those feature.
Why we have to do that?
Because angular doesn't automatically all of the files in your project, so it doesn't search all of the code you write and therefore
doesn't automatically detect all components and services and ... . Instead YOU need to tell angular what is a component, which
components do you have and you can bundle them together into modules.
Every angular app needs to have at least one module which is app module. You can't have an angular app without that module I mentioned.

Angular analyzes NgModules in order to "understand" your application and it's features. You use NgModules to define all of the
core building blocks(components, directives and ...) of your application.
Learn: So angular modules define all building blocks that your app uses.
and an app requires at least one module(app module) but might be split into multiple modules.

You also have the core angular modules which are wrapped into modules, things like formsModule. So angular itself also provides
certain features which are grouped together into such modules, therefore you don't have to declare like for example 10 different
form directives. instead that forms module gives you all of those directives.

You can't use a certain feature or building block, without including it in a module. But how you include it in a module?
You add that building block(important: A building block means a component or ...) to declarations array or providers array, depends
on the feature(building block) you are talking about.

3. Analyzing the AppModule:
We use app.module and app-routing.module to set up certain things and group them together.

We have declarations, imports, providers, bootstrap array.

In declarations array of app.modules, declarations is an array of all of the components, directives and custom pipes that
when we want to use them we add them to that array. So all of those things have to go to declarations array, otherwise you can't
use them in your templates or in your routes.

We also have imports array which allows you to import other modules into that module we are currently in it.
So imports array is crucial for splitting your app into multiple modules. Thus far, we created only one extra module which is
app-routing.module and therefore we added it into imports array of app.module . But we are also using a couple of modules which ship
with angular, like the FormsModule, the ReactiveFormsModule and ... .
Now if we look into such those modules, we would find a module with @NgModule() as well and in there, we would have a declarations
array with all the form related directives(the related directives to that module) that angular supports.
Those directives are like: automatically detecting a form element to create a form with the template driven approach or the
required or the email directives. So all of them are basically included in the FormsModule, therefore you don't have to
add all of those features which are included in the FormsModule, individually in your appModule declarations array. Because
they are already in the declarations array of FormsModule and therefore by using that FormsModule, you are already including
those features too. So we can simply import the FormsModule which speeds that process up.

The providers array we define all the services that we want to basically provide. But the relation between services and NgModules
are a bit different than components and declaration or ... . Because it's not the case that you can only use a service in the module
where you provided that service or at least that's not always the case. But we will come back to this subject. For now just
know that ANY service you plan on injecting it, needs to be provided and typically you do that in app.module OR you do that
by adding providedIn: 'root' in the object that you pass to @Injectable() in the file of that service.
That's an alternative for adding that service to your app.module providers array.

The bootstrap array is crucial for starting your app. It defines which component is available right in the index.html file
(in index.html , we instantiate app component and therefore that is the component for starting the app) and typically you only
have one component there. You could have multiple components(which is why bootstrap is also an array) in index.html but then
in that case, each component would kind of be detached from the other components. In other words, in that case(when we
have multiple bootstrap components), you would create different root component trees in your application and that's rarely what
you want. Because by doing that, it makes working those components way harder.
So therefore, you typically have one root component and you add it to bootstrap array, which by default that root component is
AppComponent.

Also we have entryComponents array in there. That array is crucial for components you create IN CODE, as you learned in dynamic
components section, that entryComponents allows angular to be aware of that dynamic component when it(angular) needs to create it
programmatically.
Also currently we have app-routing.module which we also added it to imports array of app.module file.

The AppRouting module is there to hold our route configuration. We absolutely could add all of that code in AppRoutingModule file to
AppModule file, but we only outsourced it because that's quite a lot of code and by doing that it keeps our AppModule a bit leaner
and that's already one of the reasons for why you might want to split pur application into multiple modules. It can make your
existing modules leaner and more focused and easier to edit and maintain.

The app-routing module imports the RouterModule that angular offers us in its' imports array of object that we pass to @NgModule()
and also uses a special method offered by that module(RouterModule) which is forRoot() and this method takes our route configuration
to configure the angular router with our route config and then sth crucial happens.
In the next line of that imports array, we export that RouterModule from app-routing module. Why?
Learn: We need to do that, because every module works on it's own in angular and they don't communicate with each other. So if you
 declare a component in a certain module like app module(when I say declare it in a module it means add it to declarations array of
 that module), we can ONLY use it in there and no where else.
 So when we declare a component in a certain module, we can use the selector of that component in other components of that module and
 not other module.

For smaller applications, we need our route configs which are passed into .forRoot() of AppRouting module to be available in
app.module file. In order to do that, we have to export the RouterModule which has our route configs, so that's not just available
in the app-routing module which won't be helpful at all, but by importing it in imports array of app.module, we make it available
in that module and available in components and ... that we declared in that app.module too.

Learn: So when we import module1 in a module2, we import everything that module1 exports in it's exports array.

So this was how you can configure RouterModule which ends up in the AppModule and is available in that module. This was for
small applications.

Also splitting modules is for enhance performance, not automatically by splitting components, but splitting components will be
a crucial PREREQUISITE to THEN also enhance performance. -->
<!-- 4. Getting Started with Feature Modules:
When we're working with multiple modules, instead of having one big app.module , we can split that into an app module that defines
our app.component and then we have 2 separate new modules which are called feature module

So instead of having this:

  AppModule                    AppModule            ProductsModule (feature module)
AppComponent                  AppComponent            ProductListComponent
ProductListComponent                                  ProductsComponent
ProductsComponent         =>                        OrdersModule (feature module)
OrdersComponent                                       OrdersComponent
HighlightDirective                                    HighlightDirective
....

A feature module groups components, directives, pipes that are used in a certain feature area of your application.
Splitting your app into such feature modules is the prerequisite for performance improvements and that also ensures that when other
developers work on your code, you quickly know where to look for the setup for that specific part of your app.

Now which features we have in our project?
Recipes feature area, shopping list feature area and auth feature area where we have all the components and all the logic related
to authentication.
The header and the shared components are not really the features of the app, because the header component is part of the
app component, we do render it there. So the header component definitely belongs to the root of our application(app component)
and regarding the shared components, IN THIS APP(not bigger apps) we might only use certain features in certain parts(and not all of the
parts) of the app, for example we only use the alert component in just auth component and no other places, but it would make sense
that we share that alert component across different features of our application. Because you COULD showing an alert in recipes area as
well when you failed to load recipes.
So the alert and the shared things, we'll take care of them later and they're not really a feature of this app so they don't need a
feature module for themselves.

For creating recipes module, first create a recipes.module.ts file. So just like we have the app.module for our GENERAL application,
so in app.module the core is setup for entire app, we now have recipes.module which should be responsible for defining the building
blocks of the recipe feature area.
@NgModule takes an object to configure that module. Now let's cut all of the recipes related components from app.module and move
them to recipes.module file , but it's not suffice. Because the question now is:
How we can now use our RecipesModule in the AppModule?
For that, add the exports array in the recipes.module file and export all of the components which we declared in that recipes module,
with that, now the things that we exported are also accessible in any module that imports the module that those things are
exported from that module and that could be app module too. So now, add the RecipesModule in the imports array of app.module .
Also don't forget to import that RecipeModule file in app.module and also don't mistake it with the imports array in NgModule({})
is there for angular to add features of other @NgModule()s into that @ngModule(), but the import {} ... from ...; statement is a
TS feature to tell TS where to find that type that it sits in another file and that statement has nothing to do with angular.

Now if the app compiles, we get an error which says: 'router-outlet is not a know element.' and the problems is that in the
recipes.component, I am indeed using the <router-outlet> there, the problem is that the <router-outlet> is a directive provided by
angular and it's not magically! available in the entire application. It is available by RouterModule which we imported it in the
app-routing module file.
Learn: So RouterModule is not just there to configure our routes, it also add routing features like the routerLink directive which
 we use to add a link or the router-outlet directive.

Now because we exported RouterModule from the app-routing module file  TODO till 7:45-->

<!-- 26. Angular Animations:
We can use the animation system of angular in order to for example render adding items to a list or the conditional attaching or
detaching of elements to the DOM. Because these things are hard to handle with normal css transitions or animations. Why they
are hard?
Because if you add sth to the DOM which wasn't there before and you want to animate that work, it's hard to do that with css
transition style.

3. Setting up the Starting Project:
For example we have a button that by clicking on it, an item will be added to a list. Also we created an empty <div> which I
want to animate it in this case.

4. Animations Triggers and State:
Angular animations are set up in object we pass to @Component() , so we can use them in template file of that component.
So in object we pass to @Component() , add animations array and in that array we define the animations that this component
should aware of them.
Each animation has trigger() . With trigger() we tell angular that we want to define a certain name which we can place it in
the template of that component which by placing that name, it would trigger a certain animation for that element it placed on it.
Since I defined an empty <div> to animate it, I named that animation, 'divState' . Now we must attach some animations that
this trigger() will do, because trigger('<name of animation>') itself and alone, won't do anything if placed on an element.

The second arg of trigger() defines the animation which that trigger() should toggle it and that second arg is an array.

For placing that trigger on an element in DOM. We use [] like we are doing property binding and then place:
[@<name of animation>]
Which the name of the animation is in trigger('<name of animation>')> . Now we need to bind that [@<name of animation>] to sth.
Why we must bind it?
Because the animation we define, shouldn't run all the time for that element.
Important: So we used property binding for showing animations in order to kind of bind the condition for displaying the animation.
 Which that condition is in "". So we have sth like this:
 <div [@<name of animation>]="<condition for showing that animation, till that condition is falsy and also controls which part
 of that animation should run?>">
For this example we bind that animation to a property called state which we initially set it to 'normal', the value of that prop
is up to you, but we will use that prop which would have different values it can have in trigger() . Now how we use that prop in
second arg of trigger() which that second arg is an array?
Let's say we want to define 2 states. First state is 'normal' which is the default one for that trigger() and then we want to
give it another state which is 'highlighted'.
Important: So we want an animation between 2 states and that is how angular animations work. So in angular animations,
 you transit from state1 to state2 in other words, you work with states. So because of this, we named the property which controls
 the state of animation, state. But you can name it whatever.

Now in second arg of trigger() , we define state() and we would have at leas 2 state()s! Because well, in simplest animations in
angular, we transit from state1 to state2 so we would have 2 state()s.
Now we need to give those state()s a name. For the first state() we gave it 'normal' and the name we pass to first state() should
match the initial value of the state property. So we have initial value for the property which controls the state of animation, which
we named that property, state, which has an initial value of 'normal' and this initial value should match the name we pass to
the first state() and the name we pass to state() should match the state we use in template file.
Important: The names that you pass to state() is up to you but make sure you use them in value of the property which controls states
 and also in template file. So for example if you use 'normal' and 'highlighted' in state()s, make sure you use those names for
 initial value of the prop which controls the state of animation which that prop would bind to the [@<name of animation>] in template
 file. So other crucial thing is that we bind the [@<name of animation>] to the prop which controls the state of animation.

Now how should the 'normal' and 'highlighted' states look like?
We specify that in second arg of state() . In that arg, we pass the style() method which we pass an object to it and in object
we pass to style(), it's almost like writing css code but don't use any dashes. But if you want to use dash, you must enclose that
css property in single quotes, OR by using camel case without ''.

Important: An animation always is a journey from one state to other state.
Right now we are just in beginning state which in this case is 'normal' state and now we want to go to 'highlighted' state.

So we need to get to highlighted state and also we need to animate the transition or in other words, the movement between
two states.

NOTE: We used 'transform': translateX(0) in 'normal' state and you could say: "Hey! We know that in the initial state of any element,
that element is always is in it's initial place, so writing 'transform': translateX(0) for the initial state of an element is vain!"
No it's not vain! Because the animation would also be reverse. So the animation would also have a transition from 'highlighted' state
to 'normal' state, so from 'state2' to 'state1' and they're not always limited to 'state1' to 'state2'. So we must write that
'transform': translateX(0) too, if we have plan to also transit from 'state2' to 'state1'.

5. Switching between States:
Right now in our app, we are able to display one state for animation which the name of that state is 'normal'. Or if you change the
value of the prop which controls the states of animation to 'highlighted', it would show the 'highlighted' state styles which are
defined in style({}) of 'highlighted' state.

Now we want to animate the TRANSITION between those 2 states. So we somehow need to change the state prop from our code.
Because that prop is responsible for changing the states of the animation.

In our template we have a button which when we click on it, it calls the onAnimate() method.
So let's create or hook up on the onAnimate() method in our .ts code and in that method we want to switch the state of animation.
In that method, we are checking if this.state is equal to 'normal' then we set it to 'highlighted' otherwise(otherwise means
this.state is not 'normal' right now and therefore it is definitely 'highlighted', so we set it to 'normal').


EX)
.ts file of component:
@Component({
...
animations: [
  trigger('divState', [
    state('normal', style({
      'background-color': 'red',
      'transform': 'translateX(0)'
    })),
    state('highlighted', style({
      'background-color': 'blue',
      'transform': 'translateX(100px)'
    })),
    transition('normal => highlighted', animate(300)),
    transition('highlighted => normal', animate(800))
  ])
]
})
export class AppComponent {
  state = 'normal';
  ...

  onAnimate() {
    this.state === 'normal' ? this.state = 'highlighted' : this.state = 'normal';
  }
}

.html file of component:
<div
style="width: 100px;height: 100px;"
[@divState]="state"
>
</div>

After creating that method, if you click on that button, the <div> would be gone! and that's a bug with angular because we are
using 'background-color' which has single quotes so it is a string and also another background-color which is backgroundColor which
isn't a string. So let's make it also a string. Also we need to use the dashed version of that property too, moreover both
must be string. So:
Important: You must use the very same versions of a css prop in your style object in angular animations. So for example if you used
 'background-color' in one of the states, you must use the exactly version of that css prop in other states too! So it must have
 '' and also - (not camel case).

Now by clicking on that animate button, the <div> would toggle between those two states(why toggle? Because we are toggeling between
those states in onAnimate() method. So that's why we used 'transform': 'translateX(0)' in 'normal' state. Because we are actually
toggeling between those states. So we want to go back to first place of that animated element too!).

But now we want to animate that toggle between states. This means, we don't want to instantly switch between those states which
currently we are doing that, but now we want to animate that. Because if you don't animate that transition between states, well
why you are using angular animations at all?!! Because just appending different styles to 2 different states without animating the
transition between those states can be done without angular animations and in just pure css.

6. Transitions:
Now we are able to kinda hard switch between states which means there is no animation when changing states. So we need to animate
it. So in second arg of trigger() which is an array, let's add transition() method which would sit next to the state() methods.

transition() method allows us to describe how the transition from one state to another state should work or look like or how should
be animated.
transition() as the first arg expects the name of the starting state and then a fat arrow and then the next state.
For the second arg of transition() , we specify the animate() method. The simplest thing we can pass t animate() is number of
milisedonds which that transition() should take. Also we can define some in between styles during the animation of transition too.-->
<!-- 7. Advanced Transitions
If you have same timing for both toggeling transitions, instead of saying:
  transition('normal => highlighted', animate(300)),
  transition('highlighted => normal', animate(300))
you can say:
transition('normal <=> highlighted', animate(300))

The latter means in back and forth, use the same animate() function.

Let's say you need to control the styling of the element which we are animating it, DURING the transition between states of that
animation. So NOT just control the beginning and the end state stylings, but during those states too.
For doing that, we need another state(because we want to add some styles during the transition between the prior states, so I added
another state for this purpose), so let's just use the last example with some extra stuff added to it:
EX)
@Component({
...
animations: [
  trigger('wildState', [
    state('normal', style({
      'background-color': 'red',
      'transform': 'translateX(0) scale(1)'
    })),
    state('highlighted', style({
      'background-color': 'blue',
      'transform': 'translateX(100px) scale(1)'
    })),
    state('shrunken', style({
      'background-color': 'green',
      'transform': 'translateX(0) scale(.5)'
    }))
    transition('normal' => 'highlighted', animate(300)),
    transition('highlighted' => 'normal', animate(800)),
    transition('shrunken' <=> *', animate(500))
  ])
]
})
export class AppComponent {
  state = 'normal';
  wildState = 'normal';
  ...

  onAnimate() {
    this.state === 'normal' ? this.state = 'highlighted' : this.state = 'normal';
    this.wildState === 'normal' ? this.state = 'highlighted' : this.state = 'normal';
  }

  onShrink() {
    this.wildState === 'shrunken';
  }
}

.html file of component:
<button (onClick)="onShrink()">Shrink!</button>

<div
style="width: 100px;height: 100px;"
[@wildState]="wildState"
>
</div>

But right now with that code, the shrinking is not really animated and it happens instantly when we click on the shrink! button.
So we need a third transition(), because currently we're only targeting the 'normal' and 'highlighted' states.(Therefore I added:
transition('shrunken' <=> *', animate(500)))
Why we used * in 'shrunken' <=> * ?
Because we don't care if we go or come from normal state or highlighted state, we want to play the same animation.
Important: 'shrunken' <=> * means 'shrunken' to any state and 'shrunken' from any state, should play that same transition.
Also the wildcard state is useful when you derive the state dynamically and therefore you might don't know which state that
animated element could have in that moment.

In angular animations * means any state that we have.
Also <=> means transit FROM and TO those states. eg: 'a' <=> 'b' means transition from 'a' to 'b' and from 'b' to 'a' state.

Now we need to add some in between styles between the transition() .

8. Transition Phases:
In animate() we can control the whole animation and define styles that the ANIMATION should TAKE DURING the animation. So pass the
second arg of animate() which is style() function and as we can define style() in the second arg of state() , we can also define the
style() during the animation and inside the animate() .
Now the styles we define in style() in animate() function, which those styles are kinda in between styles would taken during the animation.

EX) animations: [
  trigger('wildState', [
    state('normal', style({
      'background-color': 'red',
      'transform': 'translateX(0) scale(1)'
    })),
    state('highlighted', style({
      'background-color': 'blue',
      'transform': 'translateX(100px) scale(1)'
    })),
    state('shrunken', style({
      'background-color': 'green',
      'transform': 'translateX(0) scale(.5)'
    }))
    transition('normal' => 'highlighted', animate(300)),
    transition('highlighted' => 'normal', animate(800)),
    // transition('shrunken' <=> *', animate(500, style({
    //  borderRadius: '50px'
    // })))
    transition('shrunken' <=> *, [
      style({
        'background-color': 'orange'
      }),
      animate(1000, style({
        borderRadius: '50px'
      })),
      animate(500)
    ])
  ])
]
Now if you hit shrink! button, it's kind of ugly, because we let that border-radius to make the shape more round, but once that
transition finishes(after 500 milliseconds), it INSTANTLY jumps to the end state, which in the end state we have 0 border-radius.
So we want to SMOOTHLY have that in-between styles(in-between means the styles that we defined for the animation itself, which are
defined in style() in animate()) or in other words, NOT just animating the chainging of border-radius and then INSTANTLY
JUMP to the end state.
For doing that, we need to replace the animate() function with an array.
Learn: We can pass an array as the second arg of transition() and in that array, we can define starting and in-between states, DURING
 the transition. So we have general start and end states which animation takes place between them, but the animation itself has also
 starting and ending states, because animation itself has also styles during it's happening and therefore we need to animate the
 transition from styles of animation and styles of ending state(the general state) which animation ends there.
 So we can pass style() in array that we pass as second arg of transition().
So I commented out the third transition and wrote another one.
The first element of the array we passed as second arg of transition() in order to make the transition of styles of animation to
ending general state, smoothly, is the style() function and the second element of that array is animate() function and in there,
we place the styles that we want to smoothly change them during the transition of animation ends, to the ending state.
Important: So in our case, we should INSTANTLY see background-color of orange, thereafter we should border-radius is developing or
increasing(because any other state hasn't got any border-radius) over 1 second and thereafter we should see an animation of 500ms where
during that time, we remove the border-radius again, then turn the element from orange to the background-color of ending state.

Important: So when we pass an array to transition as the second arg, that array allows us to define different phases IN THAT transition.
 So in our case, the starting phase is that
    style({
        'background-color': 'orange'
      }),
 and it instantly applied to the latest styles that we had on that animated element(which that latest state is the latest state of
 that animated element, before entering that last transition which that transition itself has some phases). After that first phase,
 we do animate, therefore we apply styles of the new phase but over some time, so it's smoothly applying and if we have animate() without
 any styles in the last phase, that means basically transition to the GENERAL end state of the transition().
 In other words, when you pass an array as second arg of transition(), we have different phases during that transition between general
 states which those phases might have different styles and we can also define a smooth transition between those phases by using
 animate() for each phase and also we can define an animate(x) which hasn't got style function in it, in order to make the transition of
 last phase of our transition()!(in our case the last phase of transition was the border-radius) to the ending state, smoothly.
 So we defined that animate(500), in order to make the transition of last phase of our transition, smoothly to the ending state which
 that ending state is * or 'shrunken'(because of <=>).

So the crucial thing in those phases of a transition() is that you END the process of adding styles to transition, by using an animate()
function without any style, to get smoothly to the end state, otherwise it INSTANTLY snap back to the end state.
-->
<!-- 9. The void State:
Currently we're able to animate elements that we already have in our html or code. But what if we want to animate the ADDITION or
REMOVEMENT of html elements of our code?
For doing that, we can add a new trigger() and it should be of course on the same level of other trigger()s in array of animations.
There, we only have one state which is when the element IS in the DOM currently. The other state is that we don't have the element,
because we(user) just removed it OR we JUST ADDED to DOM so it kinda should now APPEAR in the DOM and that state is handled by
angular.
So 'in' state is how the element should looks like once finally IS THERE(it's in the DOM).

transform: translateX(0) means the place we ACTUALLY placed the element.

The first transition() is for when the element comes IN the DOM, so when it's added to DOM. There, the end state is 'in' but
what is the beginning state, where an element is adding to the DOM?
Well, we could use the *, but there's a specific state for the case that the element hasn't been yet added to DOM, which is 'void'
state. So 'void' is a reserved state name that you shouldn't override it.
Learn: So 'void' state is provided by angular, for cases where you do have an element and an end state which that element wasn't added
 to DOM at the beginning and of course you can add 'void' to end state, when you remove an element from DOM.

So with transition('void => *', animate(300)), the element should slowly appear to the DOM and we can see this animation by going
to where the element lives, for example <li> and on that, we add: [@<name of trigger without any quotes>] and we don't need to bind
that to anything. Because I don't CARE what the state currently is and 'in' state that we defined is just a dummy thing there.
Of course we could have some logic in our code which changes the state of our <li>s (changes the state of element that we defined
the animation on it), but for the entering animation or in other words, when we add a new <li>, I don't care what the initial state is and
therefore I never set it in our code and I never apply the 'in' state and I don't set a property for managing the state of elements that
need that state to use that animation. Because we want to animate from 'non existant' or 'void' to any state(*). Therefore we don't need
any state or state management prop for that trigger().

But right now if we try to add a <li> which has that animation to the DOM, it's not working. Why?
The issue is that we have no starting state. So we need to define a state() for 'void' right? NO!! It doesn't work that we set up
the starting state which in this case is 'void' like this:

EX) trigger('list1', [
  state('in', style({
    opacity: 1,
    transform: translateX(0)
  })),
  state('void', style({
    ...
  })),
  transition('void => *', animate(300))
])

This doesn't work in this case(but in previous triggers we have to define the starting state like that), but since 'void' state is
kinda built-in state,it works differently and we need to set it's state differently.

So as you can see, the 'in' state is a dummy state for the example below because we don't need it when adding or removing elements
in this case(because we are using * not 'in' state, so in that case we would need that 'in' state).

For doing that, in the transition() that you used the 'void' state, we must pass AN ARRAY as second arg of transition() where in there
animate() is present, but BEFORE executing animate() in that second arg of transition(), we need to write another style() where I set
the initial state of transition() itself and this style() will now be applied by angular RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING. So when we add a new
element, it's appended to DOM and it will INSTANTLY get that first style() in the transition() by angular and then transition over
x duration that we set in animate() in the transition() to it's final style which we set it in state() in example below
EX) trigger('list1', [
  // The style() functions that we write here can't be used for 'void' state.
  state('in', style({
    opacity: 1,
    transform: translateX(0)
  })),

  // This is incorrect for void state:
  state('void', style({
    ...
  })),
  transition('void => *', [

  // This style is for the 'void' state:
    style({
      opacity: 0,
      transform: translateX(-100px) // It kinda flies in
    })
    animate(300)
  ])
])

Also by using code above, when you refresh or enters this component, the elements that have this animation on them, would have that
initial state for 'void' in other words, by entering the page, they would flies in.

Now for deleting an element, let's add another transition(). For stying of ending state which is 'void', we need to do it in the last
phase of transition() which we defined those phased in second arg of transition() which is an array.
But for defining the styles of final state, we can define that final style in last animate() of transition() . But will we
get that instantly changing the styles when transit from final phase of transition to final state problem?
NO! Because in this specific case we don't have that problem of snaping to end state because the style() that we're defining there in
the last phase of transition() is actually our FINAL STATE! Why? Because the final state is void and we know that we define the style() of
a void state in the transition which is inside the transition() of that second arg array. So we are ACTUALLY defining the styles of final
state so we won't have that problem.

transition('* => void', [
  // In this case we don't need to define style() for the starting state(because the starting state is not 'void' but other states which
  // the styles of those states are set inside their state() not in first arg of transition() which is where I commented below)
  //  style({
  //    opacity: 0,
  //   transform: translateX(100px)
  //  })

  // Here we define the styles of void state(when this happens? When the void state is our final state)
    animate(300, style({
      // Styles that we would have in the end state and to get that styles it takes 300ms:
      transform: 'translateX(100px)',
      opacity: 0 // Fade out transition(fade out happens when the final state has opacity of 0)
    }))
  ])

Important: Fade out happens when the final state has opacity of 0 and fade in happens when the starting state has opacity of 1 which
 both happens over time.

These examples can used for *ngIf which we also have the behavior of some new elements being added to the DOM. -->
<!-- 10. Using Keyframes for Animations:
We can have a more detailed control over the individual steps during the animation process, we already saw that we can define multiple
phases inside each transition() as the second arg of that transition() which that second arg is an array of multiple phases of that
transition() which each phase can have animate() and for second arg of animate() we can define the styles for that phase.

And when we define multiple phases, each phase gets the same importance. It would be nice if we could define some keyframes to
specificly say: "ok, you animate over 1second. Duration that 1 second, after 200ms you should have this state, after 500ms you should
have this state and ... ."

So when we specify an array for second arg of transition() we're defining some equally weighted phases. But instead, we can still
pass an array there, but there, in the animate() function, we use the keyframes() as the second arg of animate().
Learn: Now the keyframes() in animate(), allows us to be more precise about which part of multiple styles that we set up, should occur
 at which timing. For example in animate(1000, keyframes()) , the overall animation will take 1 second but with keyframes(), now we can
 control which state INSIDE of that animation should take how long. Therefore we would have an array in keyframes() and in that array
 we would have individual phases.
In this example in keyframes() we are saying, when the element entered the DOM, it should comes in from -100px of x-axis with 0
opacity.
Now we want another style, during that fly-in animation(because we're still in the transition of void to *-so we're still in fly-in
animation). So let's add another style().

Now if you see the entrance animation, it starts slowly going in, but at near the real place of element, it goes very fast!
The reason for that is that by default all of the steps in keyframes() take long EQUALLY. In this case, we have 3 style() in keyframes()
and every style() is triggered after the another and each one is taking 1/3 second. Because we have 3 style() and the overall animate,
takes 1 second.
Learn: So by default, the overall time of animate(), distribute by each style() in the array of keyframes().
But we can overwrite that default, by passing the offset prop to the object we pass to style().
In offset, we say at which timing of our overall time of animate()(which in this case, the overall timing of animate() is 1second),
should we be at that style().
Important: 0.3 means at 30% of that animate() time.

Learn: Now for getting rid of that jumping of added element to it's place that we have currently, we can add a final style in array of
keyframes().

EX)
trigger('list2', [
  state('in', style({
    opacity: 1,
    transform: 'translateX(0)'
  })),

  // Coming in:
  transition('void => *', [
    animate(1000, keyframes([
      style({
        transform: 'translateX(-100px)',
        opacity: 0,
        offset: 0
      }),

      // Halfway to the actual place of element(because the end is translateX(0) which for example 'in' is our final state-the 'in' state
      // is one of the * states):
      style({
        transform: 'translateX(-50px)',
        opacity: .5,
        offset: 0.3
      }),
      style({
         transform: 'translateX(-20px)',
         opacity: 1,
         offset: 0.8
      }),
       style({
         transform: 'translateX(0)',
         opacity: 1,
         offset: 1
      })
    ]))
  ])
])

<li [@list2] *ngFor="...">{{item}}</li>

So we can use keyframes() to PRECISELY control which style() we wanna have at which timing of animate(), during the transition().
Important: The crucial thing is that keyframes() are for the DURING the transition. So over the times of animate()s in one transition().
Of course you can have multiple animate()s in one transition() and each animate() function can have multiple keyframes() .

If we wouldn't have keyframes(), we needed to write multiple animate()s. Let's say we want an animation takes 1 second. So we need to
write multiple animate()s which each takes some time and sum of those times, would be the overall time of animation and in each
animate() would have different styles for itself.-->
<!-- 11. Grouping Transitions:
For animating the removement of an item, let's say we want it have 2 different animations(so we can add 2 animate() functions for a
transition()) which each one takes a different amount of time.
Now if you add another animate() after the first animate() which at that first animate() we have a style which is opacity: 0; ,
you wouldn't see that item during the second animate() or animation. Because, well, during the first animation we completely make
that item transparent and any other styles after that animation wouldn't be visible to us! So the animated element would be invisible
BEFORE we see the color turned to red.
For solving this problem, we can switch the order of those 2 animate() functions. So instead of this:

EX) trigger('list1', [
    transition('* => void', [
      animate(300, style({
        transform: 'translateX(100px)',
        opacity: 0
      })),
      animate(300, style({
        transform: 'translateX(100px)',
        color: 'red'
      }))
  ])

We need to write this:
EX) trigger('list1', [
      animate(300, style({
        transform: 'translateX(100px)',
        color: 'red'
      }))
  ]),
  animate(300, style({
    transform: 'translateX(100px)',
    opacity: 0
  }))
])

So now in the animation, the item first turnes to red and also moves to right, then it would get the styles of second animate()
over the specified time.

But what if we wanted both animate()s at the same time, but with different timings?
Learn: So we don't wait for the first animation to finish before starting the next, which is the default behavior when having multiple
 animate()s.
For that we can use group(). In group(), we pass an array of animations(animate()s) that we want to perform SYNCHRONOUSLY, or at
the same time.
EX) trigger('list1', [
      group(
        animate(300, style({
          transform: 'translateX(100px)',
          color: 'red'
      }))
    ]),
  animate(800, style({
    transform: 'translateX(100px)',
    opacity: 0
  }))
])
      )

Now those 2 animate()s are happening both at the SAME TIME.
I gave the second animate() a longer time so it turns red and takes other styles in 300ms which the second animate() is also happening
with the first one but slower(because it takes 800ms!)

So we use group() to group multiple animations(or animate()s) with possibly different timings(because if the timings are the same,
why the hell we're using multiple animate()s? We can merge them in one animate()!), to have them happening at the same time.

12. Using Animation Callbacks:
There are a couple of callbacks that you can LISTEN to them, with doing that, when an animation finishes, you can execute some other
code.
For that, go to the where the element that you want them to listen those callbacks, lives and set up event binding but with @ sign,
why @ sign?
In order to indicate we're in an animationable and there we have the .start: (@<name of trigger>.start) and the
((@<name of trigger>.done) triggers(or events??? TODO).
The start method will be executed whenever the animation starts and we bind them to a method(WHY?
Because we have an event binding there). Let's see what's inside $event which is exposed by angular to see what's inside of it in
that case.
Also I want to listen to the finishing of animation by using the .done event on our trigger.

<div [@divState]="state"
 (@divState.start)="animationStarted($event)"
 (@divState.end)="animationEnded($event)"></div>

App.component.ts:
animationStarted(event) {
  console.log(event);
}

animationEnded(event) {
  console.log(event);
}

So these callbacks are useful, if you have some code which animates sth but after the animation finishes(or when it starts) you
wanna execute some other code and you can do that by listening to built-in start and done events on the trigger of animation-->

<!-- RXJS youtube academind:
RxJS what and why?
For using rxjs, first we need to install it and for this case, I won't use npm because the instructor sticks to a web based editor
(jsbin.com) and he used a cdn link and in that cdn link remove the @version in order to get it automatically replaced with the latest
version of that library. Then at the end of the <body> say: <script src="<link to rxjs cdn with replaced @version with nothing-which
gives us the latest version>"></script>
Then create a <button> and select it.
const button = document.querySelector('...');

The vanilla JS way o handle click events:
// React to clicks on the button(because we added an event listener on the button not document or ...)
button.addEventListener('click', (event) => console.log(event));

Now let's rebuilding that using rxjs:
So instead of using addEventListener(),  we write:
Rx.Observable.fromEvent() , which this, creates a new observable based on an event source which we need to specify that event source
in parentheses of fromEvent() . In this case, we specify button variable, which is where we I want to listen to that event and then
we specify the type of that event as a string.
Now with that, I already got my observable, BUT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW! Why?
To react to an event, we need to subscribe to that observable which is coming from that event.
The first function that we can pass to subscribe() gets the event data(in this case). So the result of this code is exactly as
the prior code with addEventListener() and it's callback that we passed to it.
Rx.Observable.fromEvent(button, 'click')
  .subscribe(
    (event) => {console.log(event);}
  );

By using observables, we have a funnel-like setup. So our event data travels from top to bottom, so from data source which we specify
that data source in the fromEvent() which in this case that data source is the click event on the button variable, to the code that we
execute in the subscribe() (that is the bottom!). In this case that funnel is very short.

The powerful thing about observables is the operators, which allow you to transform the way that the data is handled, used or
looks like, immensely.

EX) let's say we want to MAKE SURE that we only react to click events, once a second. So if the user SPAM(rapidly clicks on that
button which is the data source) that button, we omit or we drop all of the events which happen more than once a second.
TODO till 5:30

---------------------
Observables, observers and subscriptions:
An observable is basically a wrapper around some data source and data source typically means a stream of values.
So we have that stream data which possibly is asynchronous, so async data source is possible multiple values over time and
now we want to do sth whenever a new value of that data source occurs. This is the job of observer.
So the observer is there, to execute some code WHENEVER we receive a new value or also an error or if the observable which
we're observing reports that it's done. Therefore we need to connect the observer to observable. We do that by subscription.
Subscription basically means with subscribe() method we tell the observable(or our wrapper around that stream of values) that
someone is caring about those values or someone(observer) is listening to them.

The observer can implement up to 3 methods. You can implement some of these methods that you want. Those methods are next() ,
error() and complete() .
Important: The next() method will be called by the observable whenever a new value is emitted, so whenever we receive
 a new value.
 The error() will be called, whenever the observable throws an error and the complete() will be completed when the observable
 is done. So whenever we know that no more values will be emitted in the future.
 But remember: Some observables will NEVER finish. For example if you wrap an observable around a click listener on a button.

But how does observable know that it should call next() error() and complete() ?
Well that is a kind of contract that the observable and observer sign through the subscription. The observable knows that
it could fire a next() error() or complete() on an observer and on the other hand, observer knows that the observable will
only fire one of these 3 methods. So you can easily implement them on the observer and react to them whenever they fired.

So that is the invocation of those 3 methods which allows us to communicate and handle our data. But a better depiction is
as stream.
As I mentioned, an observable is a wrapper a stream of values and we can have one value which instantly occurs to have a
synchrounos data stream or better say it's not a stream anymore, because it's async.

Important: So the observer has 3 methods where we can handle any values in those methods.

In subscribe() we pass the observer.
The subscribe() method takes 2 possible args.
---------------------
RxJS operators like map() or throttleTime():
---------------------
RxJS6:
---------------------
switchMap():
It allows us to trigger some value emissions, whenever ANOTHER obs emits a value.

An interval, is an obs which emits a new value every x milliseconds.-->

<!-- My notes:
Important: When a router navigates to a route that renders the same component, the component isn't initialised again.
 So for rendering that component again, we can declare the dynamic segments of the url in that component and change it reactively
 by saying:
 this.route.params.subscribe((params: Params) => {
          this.user.id = params['id'];
          this.user.name = params['name'];
      });

Learn: Any properties on the component's class, are considered as reactive state and when the value of those props change,
 that component will be re-rendered.
For example we can bind the properties of that component to html template of that component by using {{}}.

When you on a component and want to implement the loading, if you are subscribing to route.params, you need to set isLoading to
true, because if the route changes, that subscription would emit a new value and you need to set isLoading to true and only
set it to false, when the data you want to use in that component or in general the data you want in any component is received.
Also there is no need to set isLoading to true inside ngOnInIt() too(so there is no need to set isLoading to true, both inside
ngOnInit() and also inside the subscription to route.params obs.). LOOK AT THE darsad-site and in it's detail-page component .
There, we are subscribing to route.params() inside ngOnInit() , by doing that, when we entered another url which that url is
handled by the same component that we were before on that component, the data would be updated, because when url changes, the
route.params subscription would emit a new value which is the new url and we send another http request for new data and update it
and also we set isLoading to true in that subscription to route.params . So whenever the url changes but that new url is also
handled by the same component, we set isLoading to true and we set it to false, when the data we requested is received.
So that is an important pattern.
-------------------
A note about pipes:
An Angular pipe is pure by default. It only triggers an update when any of the input parameters change. It's the only way that
you can "activate" the pipe (update its result). So for example if we have a pipe like:
EX) @Pipe({
    name: 'filter',
})
export class FilterPipe implements PipeTransform {
    constructor(private filterService: FilterService) {}

    transform(array: any, start?: any, end?: any): any {}
}

Important: So in the example above, only when Angular detects a change in either array, start or end, then it runs the pipe.
 Once again, changing the parameters of transform() method is the only way to control the re-running the pipe.
the first parameter to the pipe always specifies the target that the pipe acts on, usually an array (non-scalar). When
that parameter which usually is an array is changed, the pipe should be activated too, but there's a gotcha!  Since arrays are
passed by reference, when you wanna update the source array, like fetching a new page of items, if you want to trigger update,
it is important to change the array itself, not just mutate its content. So it is a good way to ASSIGN the new values to the array,
in order to change it completely. For example:
array = [...array, newItem];  // This won't update the array completely: array.push(newItem);

So stick to that rule then your pipe will behave well.
-------------------
If you're using a library in your angular application and you want to style some parts of that library or package, PROBABLY you
must put those styles in styles.scss file not the scss file on the component which is using that library.

4 different ways to share data between angular components
1) parent => child : via @Input()
When you declare a prop via @Input() in the child component, that decorator allows that prop to BE RECEIVED FROM THE PARENT
COMPONENT TEMPLATE file. After declaring that prop in child component, you can go to parent component's template and bind that
@Input prop to some code which will return sth to that binded @Input prop or just bind to a value.
Important: You can ONLY bind to the child component's @Input props not other props of that child component and ALSO you can
 only bind to that @Input() prop of child component, on INSTANCE of the child component in it's parent's template. For example:
child component.ts:
@Input message: string;

child component.html:
{{message}}

Parent template:
<app-child [<name of @Input of the child component or the other name of @Input prop that you specified in () of @Input>]=
"<some prop or code of this parent component>"></app-child>

2) child => parent : via @Output() and EventEmitter<>()
In this case, we're emitting data from child component which that data can be listened in parent component.
This approach is ideal when you want to share the data changes that occur on things like button clicks, form entries and other
user events.
In this case, we declare an event prop in the child component with @Output and set it equal to: new EventEmitter<>() . Then
we create a method in that child component that calls .emit() on that event prop and in () of that .emit() we put the data that
we want to emit or send to parent component. Then we create an event listener like (click) and bind it to our newly create method
which that method calls .emit on our EventEmitter<>() prop.
So when that event triggered(in this case the (click)), our method will be called and it would call .emit() on the EventEmitter()
and that EventEmitter() will send the data to parent component.
Now we must receive that emitted data in parent component.

In parent we create a method to receive that emitted message from child and of course it must have a parameter to actually
receive the emitted data in that parameter and then you can create a prop in that parent, in order to save the data which was
emitted from child.
Now we must somehow call this newly created method in parent. But where? In template of this parent component and again on
the instance of the child component and there, we use event binding syntax and bind to the name of the EventEmitter prop of
child component and then when that event triggers, we execute some code, which that code is that newly created method in parent.
Why when that event of child triggers we execute that newly create method of parent?
Look at the example: Because we want to RECEIVE the data which would emitted by the
EX)
child component.ts file:
@Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

sendMessage() {
  this.messageEvent.emit('hello');
}

child component.html file:
<button (click)="sendMessage()"></button>

parent component.ts file:
receiveMessage(data) {
  this.message = data;
}

parent component.html file:
<app-child (messageEvent)="receiveMessage($event)"></app-child>
{{message}}

3) child => parent: via @ViewChild()
@ViewChild() allows one component to be injected into another, which causes the parent component to gets access to all of the
props and methods of child component. However one caveat is that the child component won't be available to parent until after the
view is fully initialized. That means we need to implement AfterViewInit to receive the data from child. Then in body of parent
component, we use @ViewChild(<the name of import statement of child component>) <name of prop> and then inside ngAfterViewInit(){}
we have access to all props and methods of the child component which we can access them by using the prop that we choose for
@ViewChild()
EX)
child component.ts:
message = 'hello world';

parent component.ts file:
import {ChildComponent} from '...';
...

@ViewChild(ChildComponent) child;
message: string;

ngAfterViewInit() {
  this.message = this.child.message;
}

4) any => any: Share data between any unrelated components:
When passing data between components that lack a DIRECT connection, such as siblings, grandchildren and ..., you should use a
shared service. When you have data that always need to be in sync, BehaviorSubject() is very useful. The benefit of this kind of
subject is that it ensures every component that is consuming the service which that Behavior Subject is in it, receives the
MOST RECENT UP TO DATE data.
For doing that, in the service we create a PRIVATE BehaviorSubject<>() that will hold the CURRENT data which you want to
share that data. Then we define a current<name> property in that service which is set to an observable which will be used by components.
Then we create a method in that service which it's job is to call .next() on that BehaviorSubject() to change the current value of
that BehaviorSubject and the name of method can be: change<main name of prop>.

The parent, child and sibling components all receive the same treatment. Now for example let's go to any component that needs this data
and also needs to get the latest value and inject this service in it's constructor. Then subscribe to the currentMessage
observable and in it's first arg, we would receive the message string and then we can save that received value inside a prop of
that child component.
Now we can create a method in ANY of those components which subscribed to that BehaviorSubject() and that method would change the
data that we share between those components. But how it will change that data?
That method will call the changeMessage() method of service which that changeMessage() method calls next() on the messageSource and
we will pass the new data which that data will automatically broadcast to all of the components that subscribed to the currentMessage.
For example let's do that in parent component.

EX)
The data.service.ts file:
private messageSource = new BehaviorSubject<string>("default value");
currentMessage = this.messageSource.asObservable();

changeMessage(message: string) {
  this.messageSource.next(message);
}

child component.ts file:
message: string;
constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

ngOnInit() {
  this.dataService.currentMessage.subscribe(
    message => this.message = message;
  )
}

parent component.ts:
message: string;
constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

ngOnInit() {
  this.dataService.currentMessage.subscribe(
    message => this.message = message;
  )
}

newMessage() {
  this.dataService.changeMessage('Hello from parent');
}

parent component.html:

<button (click)="newMessage()">Send message</button>

After clicking that button in parent component, ALL of the components that are subscribed to that currentMessage will get the
latest message.-->
