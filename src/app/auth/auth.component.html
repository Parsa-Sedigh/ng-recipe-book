<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

    <!-- For disabling the submit button if this form, we can declare a local reference to this <form> element, to get the
    information about the overall form and one of the information is if that form is valid or not, so we can use that in [disabled]
    of the submit button.

    Remember: We can get access to the form object which angular creates it automatically for us, by declaring a local reference
    for the <form> and set it's value to ngForm.

    Also I want to hide the entire form if we are currently loading. For finding out we are currently loading or not, we create
    a new property named isLogin. We'll change this prop dynamically and update the UI base on that prop and right before the
    request get sent, we can set that prop to true and you must set it to false, when we are done sending that request. So in
    first callback of subscribe() and in second one, we must set that prop to false.

    By using *ngIf="!isLoading" we ensure that the form only shows up if we're currently not loading and if we are loading,
    I want to show that spinner.-->
    <div *ngIf="isLoading">
      <app-loading-spinner></app-loading-spinner>
    </div>
    <form #authForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(authForm)" *ngIf="!isLoading">
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" name="email" ngModel required email>
      </div>

      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="password">Password</label>

        <!-- We're using firebase rest api for authenticating and turns out that this rest api wants us to have at least 6
         characters. So I used minLength validator which is built-in in TD approach, on this input with value of 6.-->
        <input type="password" class="form-control" id="password" name="password" ngModel required min="6">
      </div>

      <div>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" [disabled]="!authForm.valid">{{ isLoginMode ? 'Login' : 'Signup' }}</button> |
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" (click)="onSwitchMode()">Switch to {{ isLoginMode ? 'Signup' : 'Login' }}</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
