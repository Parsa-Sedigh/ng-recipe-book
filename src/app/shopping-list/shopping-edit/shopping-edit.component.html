<!-- In <form> html element, remove the action attr, because we're not going to request to the server once this form is submitted.

 We use type="submit" on a <button> element because that button would submit the form. But type="button" won't submit the
  form.

  Before using .push() on an array, that array must first be initialized. So we don't get error of trying to use push on
  undefined.

  Source maps are a little addition which cli kind of adds to the bundled files which allow the browser to translate the
  translated js code back to ts code or to simply map the js code to our ts code.
  In development only, those sourcemaps will be stripped out for production.

  Use browser debugger with sourcemaps:
  You can see your main.bundle.js file and click on a line you want on it, then it would open the typescript file which the
  that bundled line was from that .ts file. In sources files. For accessing ts codes under webpack, you can DIRECTLY access
  .ts code. In sources, under webpack, you should find a couple of subfolders, the .ts coeds are there!

   You can also use augury and after installation you can use it in browser developers tools.-->
<!-- We can USE local references that we defined in the template of a component either by passing them as arguments to method calls
 that we do in that template OR by selecting them with @ViewChild() .

 Here we want to set things up so when user click add button, we use the value of the name input and amount input to create a
 new ingredient and add that newly created ingredient to our array of ingredients.
 Now we can pass local references or <local reference.value> to parentheses of onAdd() as arguments of that method to use
 the values of those 2 inputs in the .ts file of this component OR we can use @ViewChild() approach in .ts file .
 For the second approach, we declared 2 new properties with @ViewChild() to get those 2 local references that we defined in
 template of this component.
 For getting the local references that you were defined in template of a component in .ts file of that exact component, you
 create properties for the class of that component and declare some properties which will get those local references by using
 @ViewChild('<name of local reference>', {static: true}) on those properties. But in this approach we don't need to pass those
 2 local references when we're calling onAddItem() method on click event.

 After getting the reference to the elements that we defined local references on them(which in this case, those elements are
 those 2 <input> elements), we need to emit an event to get access to those references in parent component of this component
 by emitting an event from this component.

  Learn: When you create a custom event from the child of a parent component in order to make that parent able to get some data
   which that custom event which is defined in it's parent component, you must use @Output() on the property which is the name
   of that custom event.-->
