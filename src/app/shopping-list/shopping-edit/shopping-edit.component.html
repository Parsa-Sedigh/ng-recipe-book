<!-- In <form> html element, remove the action attr, because we're not going to request to the server once this form is submitted.

 We use type="submit" on a <button> element because that button would submit the form. But type="button" won't submit the
  form.

  Before using .push() on an array, that array must first be initialized. So we don't get error of trying to use push on
  undefined.

  Source maps are a little addition which cli kind of adds to the bundled files which allow the browser to translate the
  translated js code back to ts code or to simply map the js code to our ts code.
  In development only, those sourcemaps will be stripped out for production.

  Use browser debugger with sourcemaps:
  You can see your main.bundle.js file and click on a line you want on it, then it would open the typescript file which the
  that bundled line was from that .ts file. In sources files. For accessing ts codes under webpack, you can DIRECTLY access
  .ts code. In sources, under webpack, you should find a couple of subfolders, the .ts coeds are there!

   You can also use augury and after installation you can use it in browser developers tools.-->
<!-- We can USE local references that we defined in the template of a component either by passing them as arguments to method calls
 that we do in that template OR by selecting them with @ViewChild() .

 Here we want to set things up so when user click add button, we use the value of the name input and amount input to create a
 new ingredient and add that newly created ingredient to our array of ingredients.
 Now we can pass local references or <local reference.value> to parentheses of onAdd() as arguments of that method to use
 the values of those 2 inputs in the .ts file of this component OR we can use @ViewChild() approach in .ts file .
 For the second approach, we declared 2 new properties with @ViewChild() to get those 2 local references that we defined in
 template of this component.
 For getting the local references that you were defined in template of a component in .ts file of that exact component, you
 create properties for the class of that component and declare some properties which will get those local references by using
 @ViewChild('<name of local reference>', {static: true}) on those properties. But in this approach we don't need to pass those
 2 local references when we're calling onAddItem() method on click event.

 After getting the reference to the elements that we defined local references on them(which in this case, those elements are
 those 2 <input> elements), we need to emit an event to get access to those references in parent component of this component
 by emitting an event from this component.

  Learn: When you create a custom event from the child of a parent component in order to make that parent able to get some data
   which that custom event which is defined in it's parent component, you must use @Output() on the property which is the name
   of that custom event.-->
<!-- Don't use action attr on <form> in angular apps.
We don't need local references in order to access the form inputs and also don't need to use the click() event on button
of type="submit" in td approach or reactive.
We can get rid of the local references and onAddItem() method in this html template because we want to use TD approach
for handling the form. So we must use (ngSubmit) instead of that onAddItem() method for submitting the form.
Now we need to access the form ITSELF and not the object representation of form in TD approach by placing a local reference on
the whole form. Now we need to get access to the object representation of form instead of the DOM form element, so in order to
do that, the value of that local reference on whole form must be ngForm. By adding that ngForm, we get access to the JS object
representing the form which is created by angular behind the scenes and then pass that reference to the method which is
the value of (ngSubmit) . Now we can pass that local reference which is equal to ngForm on overall form to the method that
would be called when the form is submitted to get that object representation of form in that method which in this case is
onAddItem() . So provide an arg in declaration of this method to receive that local reference which that arg would be type of
NgForm. Because the local reference we are sending was = to ngForm.
So this was how we can submit the form but we also need to register some controls. So let's add name attributes to each input
in this form first. Also we need to add ngModel to register that input as a control in the TD approach. Remember to import
ngModel from FormsModule too otherwise that won't available. Also the button which we click on it to submit the form MUST
be of type submit. -->

            <button class="btn btn-success" type="submit" (click)="onAddItem(nameInput.value, amountInput.value)">Add</button>-->
            <!-- Second approach: Use @ViewChild('<name of local reference>', {static: true}) <property> -->
