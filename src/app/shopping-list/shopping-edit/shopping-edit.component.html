<!-- In <form> html element, remove the action attr, because we're not going to request to the server once this form is submitted.

 We use type="submit" on a <button> element because that button would submit the form. But type="button" won't submit the
  form.

  Before using .push() on an array, that array must first be initialized. So we don't get error of trying to use push on
  undefined.

  Source maps are a little addition which cli kind of adds to the bundled files which allow the browser to translate the
  translated js code back to ts code or to simply map the js code to our ts code.
  In development only, those sourcemaps will be stripped out for production.

  Use browser debugger with sourcemaps:
  You can see your main.bundle.js file and click on a line you want on it, then it would open the typescript file which the
  that bundled line was from that .ts file. In sources files. For accessing ts codes under webpack, you can DIRECTLY access
  .ts code. In sources, under webpack, you should find a couple of subfolders, the .ts coeds are there!

   You can also use augury and after installation you can use it in browser developers tools.-->
